## üöÄ Quick Start for Next Session

To continue building out the auth system, start with:

1. **Email Verification:**
   ```bash
   # Implement OTP verification page
   # Add resend code functionality
   # Add email sending service
   ```

2. **Password Reset:**
   ```bash
   # Create forgot-password page
   # Implement reset email sending
   # Create reset-password page
   # Add token validation
   ```

3. **Server Validation:**
   ```bash
   # Add password complexity checks
   # Add rate limiting middleware
   # Add account lockout logic
   ```
