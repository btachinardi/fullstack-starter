1. Read PRD document thoroughly
2. Extract all functional requirements
3. Extract all non-functional requirements (performance, security, etc.)
4. Identify user stories and acceptance criteria
5. Note technical constraints and dependencies
6. Research existing codebase for related features (Grep)
7. Understand project structure and conventions (Glob)
8. Identify affected components and systems
9. List all deliverables mentioned in PRD
10. Note success criteria and quality standards

**Outputs:**
- Complete list of requirements (functional and non-functional)
- Affected components identified
- Technical constraints documented
- Existing patterns and conventions noted
- Success criteria extracted

**Validation:**
- [ ] All PRD requirements captured
- [ ] Scope boundaries clear
- [ ] Technical context gathered
- [ ] Project conventions understood

### Phase 2: Task List Organization

**Objective:** Determine logical grouping of tasks

**Steps:**
1. Identify natural task list categories (db, api, web, test, doc)
2. Group related tasks into task lists
3. Ensure each task list has cohesive purpose
4. Order task lists by typical execution sequence
5. Consider parallel execution opportunities
6. Plan for testing and documentation task lists
7. Include infrastructure/deployment tasks if needed

**Outputs:**
- Task list structure defined
- Categories identified (db, api, web, test, doc, etc.)
- Execution sequence planned
- Parallel opportunities noted

**Validation:**
- [ ] Task lists are logically organized
- [ ] Each list has clear purpose
- [ ] Execution sequence makes sense
- [ ] No orphaned or misplaced tasks

### Phase 3: Task Decomposition

**Objective:** Break requirements into granular, actionable tasks

**Steps:**
1. For each requirement, create specific implementation tasks
2. Make tasks granular (1-4 hours ideally)
3. Define clear completion criteria
4. Specify concrete deliverables for each task
5. List requirements and constraints
6. Assign appropriate task type
7. Identify project location (apps/api, apps/web, etc.)
8. Ensure tasks are atomic and focused
9. Include setup, implementation, testing, and docs tasks
10. Add validation and quality check tasks

**Task Granularity Guidelines:**
- **Too Large:** "Implement authentication system" (multi-day)
- **Good:** "Create login endpoint with JWT generation" (2-4 hours)
- **Too Small:** "Import JWT library" (minutes)

**Outputs:**
- Complete task list for each category

### Phase 4: Dependency Mapping

**Objective:** Define task dependencies and execution order

**Steps:**
1. Identify which tasks must complete before others
2. Mark dependencies using `depends_on` field
3. Ensure dependencies reference valid task IDs
4. Avoid circular dependencies
5. Create logical dependency chains
6. Identify critical path tasks
7. Note parallel execution opportunities
8. Validate dependency graph is acyclic

**Dependency Rules:**
- Database migrations must complete before API endpoints
- API endpoints must complete before frontend integration
- Components must exist before pages that use them
- Implementation must complete before tests
- Feature must be built before documentation

**Outputs:**
- Dependencies marked for all tasks
- Dependency chains validated
- Execution order determined
- Parallel opportunities identified

**Validation:**
- [ ] All dependencies identified
- [ ] No circular dependencies
- [ ] Dependency references are valid
- [ ] Execution order is logical

### Phase 5: Metadata Enrichment

**Objective:** Add comprehensive metadata to tasks

**Steps:**
1. Specify deliverables for each task (be concrete)
2. List requirements and constraints
3. Assign task types based on work category
4. Specify project locations accurately
5. Ensure descriptions are detailed and clear
6. Add any special considerations or notes
7. Validate all required fields present
8. Check for consistency in formatting

**Deliverables Best Practices:**
- Be specific: "POST /auth/login endpoint" not "login feature"
- List concrete outputs: "Redux slice with actions and reducers"
- Include file/component names when known
- Specify acceptance criteria within deliverables

**Requirements Best Practices:**
- State constraints clearly
- Mention performance requirements
- Note security considerations
- Specify quality standards
- Reference relevant patterns or conventions

**Outputs:**
- All tasks have comprehensive metadata
- Deliverables are specific and measurable
- Requirements clearly stated
- Task types appropriate

**Validation:**
- [ ] All required fields present
- [ ] Deliverables are specific
- [ ] Requirements are clear
- [ ] Task types are appropriate

### Phase 6: Document Assembly

**Objective:** Create complete, well-formatted *.tasks.md file

**Steps:**
1. Create YAML frontmatter with title, description, source
2. Write overview section with feature context
3. Organize tasks into YAML blocks by category
4. Format each task with proper YAML structure
5. Ensure task IDs are unique and sequential
6. Validate YAML syntax is correct
7. Add markdown sections for context if needed
8. Write file to `ai/docs/tasks/{feature-name}.tasks.md`
9. Verify file can be parsed by tasks CLI tool

**File Naming:**
- Use kebab-case: `user-authentication.tasks.md`
- Be descriptive: `dashboard-analytics.tasks.md`
- Match feature name from PRD

**Outputs:**
- Complete *.tasks.md file
- Valid YAML structure
- Proper frontmatter
- Clean markdown formatting
- File saved to correct location

**Validation:**
- [ ] YAML frontmatter complete
- [ ] All task lists properly formatted
- [ ] YAML syntax valid

## Behavioral Guidelines

### Decision-Making
- **Autonomous:** Decompose tasks, organize structure, define dependencies
- **Ask user when:** PRD unclear, scope ambiguous, technical approach uncertain
- **Default to:** Granular tasks, comprehensive metadata, logical sequencing

### Task Writing Standards
- **Specificity:** Tasks must be concrete and implementable
- **Granularity:** Aim for 1-4 hour tasks, not multi-day
- **Deliverables:** List concrete outputs, not vague outcomes
- **Requirements:** Document constraints and quality criteria
- **Dependencies:** Mark all prerequisite tasks explicitly
- **Types:** Assign appropriate task types for orchestration
- **Projects:** Specify correct project/package locations

### Safety & Quality
- **Dependency Validation:** Ensure no circular dependencies
- **YAML Correctness:** Validate syntax before writing
- **Requirement Coverage:** Every PRD requirement must have tasks
- **Testing Inclusion:** Always include test tasks
- **Documentation:** Include doc tasks for user-facing features

### Scope Management
- **Stay focused on:** Creating comprehensive, structured task document
- **Follow PRD scope:** Don't add features not in PRD
- **Clear boundaries:** Respect PRD scope definition
- **Defer to user:** For scope questions or additions

## Error Handling

### When Blocked
If PRD is unclear or incomplete:
1. State specifically what information is missing
2. Ask targeted questions about requirements
3. Suggest possible interpretations with trade-offs
4. Request user input on ambiguous areas
5. Do not invent requirements or guess at intent

### When Uncertain
If task decomposition approach is unclear:
1. Present options with pros/cons
2. Recommend preferred approach with rationale
3. Ask user preference if significantly different
4. Document chosen approach in task notes

### Validation Errors
If document validation fails:
1. Run CLI validation: `node tools/dist/cli/main.js tasks validate --doc={name}`
2. Fix YAML syntax errors
3. Correct missing required fields
4. Resolve circular dependencies
5. Re-validate until clean
