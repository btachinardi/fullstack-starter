I'm ready to assist you with this project. Let me start by understanding the current state of the repository.

**Current Status:**
- **Branch**: main
- **Platform**: Windows (Git Bash environment)
- **Today's date**: 2025-10-20
- **Recent changes**: Modified README and PRD documentation files, plus a new scope analysis document

**Key Context from Instructions:**
I'm operating under a comprehensive set of principles emphasizing:
- Evidence-based reasoning over assumptions
- Code over documentation
- Efficient parallel operations
- SOLID principles and clean code
- Data-driven decision making

**Tool Approach:**
- **Preferred tools**: Specialized MCP tools > Claude Code tools > Bash commands
- **Parallel operations**: Execute independent operations together
- **Absolute paths**: All file references use full paths on Windows
- **Git workflow**: Feature branches only, never direct to main

**Let me know what you'd like me to help with for this fullstack-starter project.** 

I can:
- Explore and analyze the codebase structure
- Search for specific patterns or files
- Review documentation and PRDs
- Help with implementation or refactoring
- Create execution plans for features
- Provide code analysis and improvements

What would you like to focus on?
