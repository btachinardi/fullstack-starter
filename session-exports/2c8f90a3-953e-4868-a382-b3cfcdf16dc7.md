## 🤖 Assistant _8:55:48 PM_

Based on my analysis of the staged changes, I can see this is a significant refactoring that:

1. **Removes old documentation and scripts** from `.claude-code/` directory
2. **Reorganizes slash commands** (moves git-commit to git/commit namespace)
3. **Refactors the tools system** with new CLI, logger service, and logs tool
4. **Removes Python/shell scripts** for subagent commit management
5. **Updates documentation** to reflect the new structure

This is a cleanup and consolidation effort. Let me create an appropriate commit:

---

## 🔧 Tool: Bash _8:55:55 PM_

**Command:** `git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
refactor: consolidate agent tools and remove deprecated code

Major cleanup and consolidation of the agent tooling system:

**Removed deprecated files:**
- Deleted .claude-code/* documentation and agents (moved to ai/*)
- Removed ai/scripts/* Python and shell scripts for subagent commits
- Cleaned up old agent creator and command creator files

**Refactored tools system:**
- Added comprehensive CLI (tools/src/cli/main.ts) for logs and commits
- Implemented logger service (tools/src/services/logger.ts)
- Added logs tool (tools/src/tools/logs.ts) for session management
- Refactored subagent-stop hook with new session parsing
- Updated package.json with new dependencies (commander, chalk, etc.)

**Reorganized slash commands:**
- Moved /git-commit to namespaced /git:commit
- Updated slash command creator agent and guidelines
- Streamlined command creation documentation

**Updated documentation:**
- Enhanced tools/README.md with CLI usage
- Improved hooks/README.md with context and examples
- Updated references to new file locations

This consolidates the codebase by removing redundant Python scripts in favor
of TypeScript tooling, improves organization with namespaced commands, and
provides better developer experience with the new CLI interface.
