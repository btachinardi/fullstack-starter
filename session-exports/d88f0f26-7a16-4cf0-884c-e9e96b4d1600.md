Warmup

## ðŸ¤– Assistant _9:03:00 PM_

I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI for Claude, and I'm ready to help you search through your codebase. I have access to powerful tools for:

- **Glob pattern matching** - to find files by name and path
- **Grep/Regex searching** - to find content within files
- **File reading** - to analyze specific files
- **Bash operations** - for file system tasks

I can see you're working in a fullstack-starter project on the main branch. The repository shows several recent changes including modifications to CLI tools, hooks, and agent-related files.

I'm warmed up and ready to help! What would you like me to search for or explore in your codebase?
