feat(agents): add permissions optimizer agent

Add specialized agent for managing Claude Code permissions with security-focused analysis. This agent consolidates bloated permission lists into maintainable generic patterns using a three-tier model (ALLOW/DENY/ASK) while preventing security vulnerabilities like accidental force pushes, hard resets, or package publishing.

Key capabilities:
- Analyzes and consolidates redundant permission entries
- Security risk analysis for all permission patterns
- Three-tier permission model implementation
- Pattern-based optimization for git, package managers, and file operations
- Prevents dangerous operations while maintaining workflow efficiency

## 🤖 Assistant _9:33:04 PM_

I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI for Claude. I'm ready to help you search and explore your codebase.

I can see you're working in a fullstack-starter project on the main branch. The repository appears to have recent activity related to configuration updates and Claude Code agents/commands.

I'm ready to assist with:
- **File searching** using glob patterns
- **Content searching** using regex with grep
- **File reading** for specific paths
- **Directory operations** using bash commands

What would you like me to search for or explore in your codebase?
