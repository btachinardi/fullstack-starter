Now I'll analyze the staged changes and create an appropriate semantic commit message. Based on the diff, I can see this is a major update to the git commit workflow that:

1. Adds `autoCommit` field to multiple agent configurations
2. Creates new context-test agent
3. Creates SUBAGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md
4. Updates SUBAGENT_GUIDELINES.md and SUBAGENT_TEMPLATE.md
5. Adds hook detection logic to tools/src/hooks/subagent-stop.ts
6. Completely refactors the /git:commit command to delegate to commit-grouper and commit-message-generator subagents

This is a comprehensive refactoring that introduces a new delegated workflow for commits. Let me create the commit:

## 🔧 Tool: Bash _9:54:26 PM_

**Command:** `git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
refactor(git): delegate commit workflow to specialized subagents

Complete overhaul of /git:commit to use delegation pattern with commit-grouper 
and commit-message-generator subagents running in parallel. Adds autoCommit flag 
to agent configs for automatic commit on completion. Implements SubagentStop hook 
integration for seamless agent-initiated commits with metadata tracking.

Major changes:
- Add autoCommit field to agent configs (subagent-creator, slash-command-creator, etc.)
- Create context-test agent for subagent context validation
- Add SUBAGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md with standardized agent guidelines
- Update SUBAGENT_TEMPLATE.md and SUBAGENT_GUIDELINES.md
- Implement hook detection in tools/src/hooks/subagent-stop.ts
- Refactor commit.md to 5-phase workflow: git status → delegate grouper → 
  parallel message generators → execute commits → hook integration
- Replace monolithic commit logic with specialized subagent delegation
- Add parallel Task invocation for commit-message-generator efficiency

This enables intelligent multi-commit workflow where commit-grouper analyzes 
changes and commit-message-generator creates semantic messages in parallel.

I'm ready to help! I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's CLI file search specialist. I'm equipped to:

- **Search files** using glob patterns for broad matching
- **Search file contents** using regex patterns with grep
- **Read specific files** when I know the exact path
- **Perform file operations** using bash commands

I can see I'm working in your fullstack-starter project repository on the main branch. I notice there are several modified files related to agents, commands, and hooks, with recent commits focused on multi-commit workflow infrastructure and subagent development.

I'm ready to help you search through your codebase. What would you like me to find or explore?
