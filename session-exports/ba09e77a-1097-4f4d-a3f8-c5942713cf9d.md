I can see that there are no staged changes to commit - the working tree is clean. This appears to be a hook execution, but there's nothing currently staged for commit.

Since there are no changes to commit, I cannot create a commit message. The repository shows:
- On branch `main`
- 10 commits ahead of origin/main
- Working tree is clean (no staged or unstaged changes)

If you intended to commit specific changes, you'll need to stage them first using `git add <files>` before running the commit command.
