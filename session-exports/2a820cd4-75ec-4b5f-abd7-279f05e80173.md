## 🤖 Assistant _8:56:10 PM_

Now I'll create a semantic commit message based on the staged changes. The changes involve:

1. **Cleanup**: Removing old `.claude-code` directories and agent files
2. **Refactor**: Reorganizing slash command structure (git-commit.md → git/commit.md)
3. **Update**: Enhancing documentation and guidelines in `ai/` directory
4. **Remove**: Deleting Python scripts that are no longer needed
5. **Feature**: Adding new logger service and logs tool
6. **Update**: Modifying hooks and services

This appears to be a refactoring/reorganization effort with some cleanup and new tooling additions.

**Command:** `git add -A && git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
refactor: reorganize claude config structure and add logging tools

Major reorganization of claude configuration and tooling:

- Remove deprecated .claude-code directory structure
- Migrate slash commands to namespaced structure (git/commit)
- Remove obsolete Python scripts for subagent commits
- Add structured logging service with winston
- Create new logs CLI tool for log file management
- Update subagent-stop hook with improved session handling
- Enhance slash command and agent creator documentation
- Update settings to reflect new command structure

This consolidates the project structure, improves maintainability,
and adds better observability through structured logging.
