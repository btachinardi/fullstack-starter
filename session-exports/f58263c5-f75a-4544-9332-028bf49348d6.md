## 🤖 Assistant _1:43:36 PM_

I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI for Claude, ready to help you navigate and explore your codebase. I'm currently in your fullstack-starter project directory at `C:\Users\bruno\Documents\Work\Projects\fullstack-starter`.

I can see you're on the main branch with several modified files related to CLI tools, settings, logging, and session parsing. I also notice there are project-level instructions in `CLAUDE.md` that reference `@PRINCIPLES.md` and `@RULES.md`.

I'm ready to help you with:
- Finding files using glob patterns
- Searching code and text with regex patterns
- Reading and analyzing specific files
- Exploring your codebase structure

What would you like me to search for or analyze in your project?

/git:commit

Subagent context (from SubagentStop hook):
- Agent: ci-debugger
- Session ID: 01a6b79e-77f7-408d-9443-82d8a4b26da7
- Invocation ID: toolu_01ThpNJz7nbx3miwb3Dah8BL

Prompt:
Execute full local CI pipeline validation and fix all failures systematically.

## Current CI Status:
- ✅ Bootstrap: PASSED
- ❌ Lint: FAILED
- ❌ Type Check: FAILED  
- ❌ Test: FAILED
- ❌ Build: FAILED (critical - blocking other failures)
- ⏭️ Security: SKIPPED (tools not installed)

## Critical Issue Identified:
The primary root cause is that **Prisma client has not been generated**. The error `Module '"@prisma/client"' has no exported member 'PrismaClient'` in `@starter/platform-db` indicates `prisma generate` needs to be run.

This is causing cascading build failures in:
- @starter/platform-db (missing PrismaClient)
- @starter/ui (depends on @starter/utils build outputs)
- @starter/data-access (depends on @starter/utils build outputs)

## Your Task:
1. Run the complete CI pipeline: `pnpm ci:local`
2. Identify all failing jobs (bootstrap, lint, typecheck, test, build)
3. **Fix the Prisma client generation issue FIRST** - this is blocking builds
4. Systematically fix remaining issues:
   - Delegate to lint-debugger for extensive lint/type issues (>50 lint errors OR >20 type errors)
   - Delegate to test-debugger for test failures (>10 test failures)
   - Fix build issues directly
5. Iterate until ALL CI jobs pass with 100% success rate

## Expected Outcome:
- All CI jobs passing (✅ PASS status)
- Lint: 0 errors
- Type Check: 0 errors  
- Test: 100% pass rate
- Build: All packages built successfully
- Project ready for commit

Begin by running `pnpm ci:local` to see the current failures, then fix them systematically starting with the Prisma client generation issue.

Please analyze the staged changes and create an appropriate semantic commit message.
Since this is from a hook, auto-approve and execute the commit without user interaction.
