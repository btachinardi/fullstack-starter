/git:commit

Subagent context (from SubagentStop hook):
- Agent: subagent-creator
- Session ID: 65618ff3-0cc3-47fa-92f2-b71a63447a1e
- Invocation ID: toolu_013WcHQYipuKJRcJnWV8D8Qj

Prompt:
Create a specialized subagent with the following specification:

**test-debugger**
- Name: test-debugger
- Purpose: Runs all project tests, identifies failures, and fixes them iteratively until all tests pass
- Capabilities:
  - Discovers and runs all test suites in the project
  - Analyzes test failure messages and stack traces
  - Identifies root causes of test failures
  - Fixes one failing test at a time systematically
  - Re-runs tests after each fix to verify and identify next failure
  - Continues iteration until all tests pass
  - Handles unit, integration, and e2e test failures
  - Preserves existing test coverage and functionality
- Tools needed: All tools (needs to read code/tests, edit files, run test commands)
- Workflow: Run tests â†’ Identify failure â†’ Fix root cause â†’ Re-run â†’ Repeat until all pass
- When to use: When tests are failing, after refactoring, or before releases
- Success criteria: All test suites pass with 100% success rate

Please create this subagent following project templates and best practices.

Please analyze the staged changes and create an appropriate semantic commit message.
Since this is from a hook, auto-approve and execute the commit without user interaction.

I'm ready to help you search and navigate your codebase! I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's file search specialist, and I'm equipped to:

- **Find files** using glob patterns across your project
- **Search content** with powerful regex patterns
- **Read and analyze** specific files
- **Perform file operations** to help you explore the codebase

I can see you're working in the **fullstack-starter** project on the **main** branch. The repository appears to have recent additions including several new agent configuration files related to planning, research, testing, and validation.

I'm ready to help with your search requests. Just let me know what you're looking for - whether it's:
- Finding files matching certain patterns
- Searching for specific code or text
- Reading and understanding file contents
- Exploring project structure
- Any other code navigation task

What would you like me to search for?

## ðŸ¤– Assistant _11:21:55 PM_

Based on my analysis of the staged changes, I can see that 5 new agent files have been created across different specialized domains:
- Planning agent: `todo-writer.md`
- Research agent: `research-writer.md`
- Testing/validation agents: `test-writer.md`, `test-debugger.md`, `lint-debugger.md`

This follows the recent pattern of adding specialized agents with clear domain organization. Let me create the commit:

feat(agents): add specialized planning, research, and validation agents

Add five new specialized agents organized by domain:
- todo-writer: Generates comprehensive todo documents from PRDs and feature specs
- research-writer: Conducts technical research and creates structured research documents
- test-writer: Creates comprehensive test suites with best practices
- test-debugger: Iteratively fixes failing tests until all pass
- lint-debugger: Fixes all linting and type-checking errors systematically

These agents expand the toolkit for planning, research, and quality assurance workflows.
