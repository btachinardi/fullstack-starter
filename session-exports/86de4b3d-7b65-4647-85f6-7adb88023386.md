I'll analyze the staged changes and create a semantic commit message, then execute the commit automatically.

I can see that there are no staged changes currently - the working tree is clean. This appears to be a git hook invocation, but there's nothing to commit at this moment.

Since the `/git:commit` command was triggered (likely from a hook) but there are no staged changes, there's nothing to commit. The repository shows:
- Working tree is clean
- No staged changes
- Branch is ahead of origin by 12 commits (unpushed commits)

**No action needed** - there are no changes to commit. If you intended to commit changes, please stage them first using `git add`.
