feat(agents): add permissions-optimizer agent for security-focused permission management

Add specialized agent to consolidate bloated permission lists and migrate to three-tier permission model (ALLOW/DENY/ASK). This agent prevents security vulnerabilities like accidental force pushes while maintaining development workflow efficiency.

Key capabilities:
- Analyzes and consolidates redundant permission patterns
- Security risk assessment for all permission changes
- Automated migration to three-tier model
- Backup creation before modifications
- Clear security analysis reporting

Tools: Read, Write, Bash
Model: claude-sonnet-4-5 (security analysis requires advanced reasoning)
