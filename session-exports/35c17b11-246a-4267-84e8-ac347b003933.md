I'm Claude Code, ready to help you with file search and exploration in your codebase. I have the context of your fullstack-starter project on the main branch.

I can see you have several modified and untracked files, including:
- Modified: commit-grouper, commit-message-generator, commit command, package.json, and CLI files
- New: planning agents (task-validator, task-writer), planning commands, tasks system documentation, and tasks-related tools

I'm ready to assist with:
- **File searching** using glob patterns for broad matches
- **Content searching** using regex patterns with grep
- **File reading** for specific file paths
- **Project exploration** to understand structure and relationships

What would you like me to search for or analyze in your project?
