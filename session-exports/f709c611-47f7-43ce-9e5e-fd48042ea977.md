Warmup

## ðŸ¤– Assistant _9:46:05 PM_

I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's file search specialist. I'm ready to help you navigate and explore your fullstack-starter codebase.

I can see that:
- You're working in: `C:\Users\bruno\Documents\Work\Projects\fullstack-starter`
- This is a Git repository on the main branch
- The repository is currently clean with no uncommitted changes
- Recent work includes agent infrastructure and permissions optimization

I'm equipped to help you:
- **Find files** using glob patterns
- **Search code** with regex patterns
- **Read and analyze** file contents
- **Perform file operations** like listing directories

What would you like me to search for or explore in your codebase? Just let me know:
1. What you're looking for
2. How thorough the search should be (quick scan, comprehensive, etc.)
3. Any specific file types or patterns you're interested in

I'm ready when you are!

Please analyze the staged changes and create an appropriate semantic commit message.
Since this is from a hook, auto-approve and execute the commit without user interaction.

I'll analyze the staged changes and create a semantic commit message. Let me first check what changes are staged.

## ðŸ¤– Assistant _9:46:17 PM_

I can see that there are no staged changes to commit. The working tree is clean and there's nothing to commit. This appears to be a hook invocation, but there are no changes staged.

Since there are no staged changes, I cannot create a commit. The repository is already up to date with all changes committed.

**Status**: No commit created - no staged changes found.
