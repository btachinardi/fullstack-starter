@.claude\agents\claude\slash-command-creator.md This agent was used to generate @.claude\commands\git\commit.md , but notice how the slash command has no frontmatter. What is wrong with te current subagent? Why is it not doing such an important and trivial step of creating a new slash command? Are we missing instructions?

## 🤖 Assistant _7:50:08 PM_

I found the issue! Looking at the `slash-command-creator` agent definition, there's an **explicit instruction that's incorrect**:

On line 280, in the Quality Standards section:

```markdown
### Output Format
- **File Location**: `.claude/commands/[category]/[command-name].md` or `.claude/commands/[command-name].md`
- **File Format**: Markdown (no YAML frontmatter for commands)  ⬅️ THIS IS WRONG
- **Content Structure**: Follows SLASH_COMMAND_TEMPLATE.md exactly
- **Naming Convention**: Kebab-case, descriptive, action-oriented
```

The agent is being told **"no YAML frontmatter for commands"**, which contradicts what slash commands actually need.

Let me check the template files the agent references to confirm what the correct format should be:

This creates ambiguity about when and where frontmatter should be used across different file types. The discrepancy between agent files (with rich metadata) and command files (without metadata) highlights a need for clearer, consistent documentation about frontmatter usage.

---

## 🤖 Assistant _7:50:50 PM_

Now I can see the complete picture. Here's the issue:

## The Problem

**The `slash-command-creator` agent has an explicit instruction that contradicts best practices:**

Line 280 in `slash-command-creator.md`:
```markdown
### Output Format
- **File Format**: Markdown (no YAML frontmatter for commands)  ⬅️ WRONG
```

**However, the guidelines are ambiguous:**

Lines 726-744 in `SLASH_COMMAND_GUIDELINES.md` say frontmatter is "optional" and only "some systems support" it - which is vague and unhelpful.

## Current State vs. Expected State

**Agent files** (`.claude/agents/...`) **HAVE frontmatter:**
```yaml
---
name: slash-command-creator
description: Creates optimized custom...
tools: Read, Write, Glob, Grep, Edit
model: claude-sonnet-4-5
---
```

**Slash command files** (`.claude/commands/...`) **DON'T HAVE frontmatter:**
- `.claude/commands/agents/create.md` - No frontmatter ❌
- `.claude/commands/git/commit.md` - No frontmatter ❌

## What's Missing

The agent should be creating slash commands **with frontmatter**, but it's explicitly told not to. The frontmatter should likely include:

```yaml
---
name: git:commit
description: Intelligently commit git changes using semantic commit messages
category: workflow
version: 1.0
---
```

## What Needs to Be Fixed

**Option 1: If slash commands SHOULD have frontmatter (recommended):**
1. Update `slash-command-creator.md` line 280 to say **"Markdown WITH YAML frontmatter"**
2. Add explicit instructions on what frontmatter fields are required
3. Update `SLASH_COMMAND_GUIDELINES.md` to make frontmatter **mandatory**, not optional
4. Update `SLASH_COMMAND_TEMPLATE.md` to include frontmatter at the top

**Option 2: If slash commands really DON'T need frontmatter:**
1. Update the guidelines to be explicit: "Slash commands do NOT use frontmatter (unlike agent files)"
2. Document WHY they don't need it

**My recommendation:** Slash commands SHOULD have frontmatter for consistency with agents and to enable future features (command palette, categorization, versioning).

Would you like me to fix the `slash-command-creator` agent to include frontmatter generation?

## 🤖 Assistant _7:57:19 PM_

No problem! I've completed all the fixes. Here's a summary of what was corrected:

## ✅ Fixed Issues

### 1. **SLASH_COMMAND_TEMPLATE.md** - Added frontmatter
Updated the template to include YAML frontmatter at the top:
```yaml
---
description: One-line description of what this command does and when to use it
argument-hint: [optional arguments]
allowed-tools: Tool1, Tool2
model: claude-sonnet-4-5
---
```

### 2. **SLASH_COMMAND_GUIDELINES.md** - Made frontmatter mandatory
- Changed from "Optional" to required frontmatter section
- Documented all official Claude Code frontmatter fields:
  - `description` (recommended): Shown in command palette
  - `argument-hint` (optional): Shows expected arguments
  - `allowed-tools` (optional): Restricts tool usage
  - `model` (optional): Specifies model for the command
  - `disable-model-invocation` (optional): Prevents SlashCommand tool invocation
- Updated all examples throughout the guide to include frontmatter

### 3. **slash-command-creator agent** - Fixed frontmatter generation
Updated multiple sections:
- **Phase 3** instructions now explicitly require writing YAML frontmatter first
- **Validation checklists** now include frontmatter verification
- **Examples** updated to show frontmatter
- **Success metrics** include frontmatter validation
- Changed line 280 from "no YAML frontmatter" to "Markdown with YAML frontmatter"

## Why This Matters

**Before the fix:** The agent was explicitly told NOT to create frontmatter, which meant:
- No command descriptions in the palette
- No argument hints for users
- No tool restrictions
- No model specifications
- Inconsistent with agent files (which DO have frontmatter)

**After the fix:** All slash commands will now include:
- Proper metadata for discovery
- Tool restrictions for safety
- Argument hints for usability
- Model specifications when needed

The next time you use the `slash-command-creator` agent, it will automatically generate proper frontmatter for all new slash commands!

Perfect! I've added the YAML frontmatter to `.claude/commands/git/commit.md`:

```yaml
---
description: Intelligently commit git changes using semantic commit messages with smart grouping for multi-concern changes
allowed-tools: Bash(git *:*), Read, Grep, Glob
model: claude-sonnet-4-5

```

**Frontmatter breakdown:**
- **description**: Concise description shown in command palette
- **allowed-tools**: Restricted to git Bash commands plus file analysis tools (Read, Grep, Glob) needed for the change analysis phases
- **model**: `claude-sonnet-4-5` for the sophisticated reasoning required to analyze changes, generate semantic messages, and orchestrate multi-commit strategies

The `/git:commit` command now follows the proper format and will work correctly with Claude Code's command system!

Perfect! Now, we should add instructions in this command to standardize how subagent invocation details must be added to the commit message. Look at @tools\src\hooks\subagent-stop.ts to see how the hook will invoke this command.

In our semantic commit messages, when we use `feat(<feature_name>)`, it should look something like `feat(api|ui|dashboard|cli)`, and not be about who implemented thhe feature, like you are doing in `feat(agent)`. We could have a legit case for `feat(agent)` when the commit is about the agent system, but not when the agent is doing the commit.

## 🤖 Assistant _8:12:41 PM_

You're absolutely right! The scope should indicate **WHAT** part of the system was changed, not **WHO** made the change.

So the commit format should be:
- `feat(api): add authentication endpoints` - if agent added API features
- `feat(ui): add login form component` - if agent added UI features  
- `feat(agents): add API validator subagent` - if agent created a new subagent
- `feat(commands): add git commit command` - if agent created a new slash command
- `fix(web): resolve form validation bug` - if agent fixed a web bug
- `docs: update API documentation` - if agent updated docs (no scope needed)

The fact that it was done by an agent is metadata in the footer, not the scope.

Let me revise the Phase 5 instructions to reflect this:

---

## 🤖 Assistant _8:14:05 PM_

Perfect! I've updated the `/git:commit` command to correctly use semantic commit scopes. Here's what changed:

## Key Corrections

**Before (incorrect):**
- `chore(agent): add API validator subagent` ❌
- Scope indicated WHO made the change (agent)

**After (correct):**
- `feat(agents): add API validator subagent` ✅
- Scope indicates WHAT was changed (agents directory)
- Type indicates it's a new feature (feat)

## Scope Mapping for Agent Changes

The command now correctly maps file paths to scopes:
- `.claude/agents/` → `feat(agents)` or `fix(agents)`
- `.claude/commands/` → `feat(commands)` or `fix(commands)`
- `apps/api/` → `feat(api)` or `fix(api)`
- `apps/web/` → `feat(web)` or `fix(web)`
- `docs/` → `docs:` (typically no scope)

## Agent Metadata in Footer

The fact that a commit was made by an agent is preserved in the footer:
```
Agent: subagent-creator
Session-ID: 1a7d9110-f81d-4bba-aa6f-2a1e017fbc2d
...
🤖 Auto-committed via /git:commit from SubagentStop hook
```

This way the commit message follows proper semantic conventions while still capturing the automation context!
