I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI for Claude. I'm ready to help you navigate and search through your codebase.

I've reviewed the context:
- **Working directory**: C:\Users\bruno\Documents\Work\Projects\fullstack-starter
- **Git status**: On main branch with modifications to .claude/settings.local.json, ai/requests/tasks-tool.md, and packages/utils/package.json
- **Environment**: Windows (win32), Today's date is 2025-10-21

I'm equipped to:
- Search files using glob patterns and regex
- Read and analyze file contents
- Provide file navigation and exploration
- Follow your project's engineering principles (Evidence > Assumptions, Code > Documentation, Efficiency > Verbosity)

What would you like me to search for or explore in your fullstack-starter project?
