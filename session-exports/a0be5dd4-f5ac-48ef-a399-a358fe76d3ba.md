Warmup

## ðŸ¤– Assistant _2:57:35 PM_

I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI for Claude, and I'm ready to help you search and explore your codebase. I'm currently set up in your fullstack-starter project and equipped to help you find files, search code, and analyze your project structure.

I can help you with tasks like:
- Finding files using glob patterns
- Searching code with regex patterns
- Reading and analyzing file contents
- Understanding your project structure

What would you like me to search for or explore in your codebase?

/git:commit

Subagent context (from SubagentStop hook):
- Agent: subagent-creator
- Session ID: 302e7990-d417-486d-95c0-490990124dfb
- Invocation ID: toolu_01DHzWyDYzBJ9M5RFX34csWk

Prompt:
Migrate the slash-command-creator.md agent to slash-command-writer.md as a writer agent. This means:

1. **Rename**: Change name from "slash-command-creator" to "slash-command-writer"
2. **Update description**: Change to "Writes (creates and updates) optimized custom Claude Code slash commands following project templates and best practices. Use when users want to create new slash commands or improve existing ones."
3. **Generalize terminology**: Replace "create/creator/creation" language with more flexible terms:
   - "Creates" â†’ "Writes" or "Generates"
   - "Creating" â†’ "Writing" or "Generating"
   - "Creation" â†’ "Writing" or "Generation"
   - "Creator" â†’ "Writer"
   - Make it clear the agent can BOTH create new AND update existing commands
4. **Keep Edit tool**: The agent already has Edit tool which is good for updates
5. **Update methodology phases**: Make phases work for both creating new and updating existing commands
6. **Update examples**: Include examples of both creating new commands AND updating/improving existing ones

The agent should be positioned as handling all command file operations (create, update, improve), not just creation.

Source file: .claude/agents/claude/slash-command-creator.md
Target file: .claude/agents/claude/slash-command-writer.md

Remember to use the temporary file approach documented at the end of the agent file for working with .claude folder files.

Please analyze the staged changes and create an appropriate semantic commit message.
Since this is from a hook, auto-approve and execute the commit without user interaction.

Perfect! Now I'll create a semantic commit message based on the staged changes. The changes include:

1. **New writer agents**: Two new "writer" agents (slash-command-writer and subagent-writer) that handle both creation AND updates
2. **Settings update**: Updated .claude/settings.local.json with new agent configurations
3. **Dependencies**: pnpm-lock.yaml and tools/package.json changes
4. **Hook enhancement**: Modified subagent-stop.ts hook to support the new agent workflow

This is a **feature** commit that introduces writer agents as a generalization of creator agents.

feat(agents): introduce writer agents to handle creation and updates

Add new slash-command-writer and subagent-writer agents that generalize
the functionality of creator agents. These agents can both create new
artifacts and update existing ones, making them more versatile.

Key changes:
- Add slash-command-writer.md agent for writing/updating slash commands
- Add subagent-writer.md agent for writing/updating sub-agents
- Update .claude/settings.local.json with new agent configurations
- Enhance subagent-stop hook to support writer agent workflows
- Update dependencies in tools/package.json and pnpm-lock.yaml

Writer agents replace the concept of separate creator/updater agents
with a unified approach that handles both creation and modification
operations in a single agent definition.
