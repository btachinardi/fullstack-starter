I'll analyze the staged changes and create a semantic commit message, then execute the commit automatically.

I can see that there are no staged changes to commit - the working tree is clean. This appears to be a hook invocation, but there's nothing currently staged for commit.

Since there are no changes to commit, I cannot create a commit message or execute a commit. The repository shows:
- Working tree is clean (no staged or unstaged changes)
- Branch is ahead of origin/main by 9 commits (these are already committed)

If you intended to commit changes, please stage them first using `git add` before running the commit command.
