Now I'll analyze the changes to create an appropriate semantic commit message. Based on the diff and git status, this appears to be a refactoring and enhancement of the subagent workflow system. Let me create a commit:

---

## 🔧 Tool: Bash _8:55:51 PM_

**Command:** `git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
refactor: consolidate subagent workflow and enhance tooling

Major refactoring of the subagent and slash command creation workflow:

**Cleanup:**
- Remove deprecated `.claude-code/` agents and templates
- Remove obsolete Python/PowerShell scripts for subagent commits
- Consolidate documentation into canonical ai/claude/ structure

**Enhancements:**
- Add structured logging service with level-based filtering
- Add logs tool for viewing session and agent output
- Improve subagent-stop hook with better error handling
- Update slash-command-creator agent with improved instructions

**Organization:**
- Move git:commit command to namespaced structure
- Sync guidelines and templates to ai/claude/commands/
- Update agent creator documentation with latest patterns
- Improve README documentation for tools and hooks

This consolidation reduces duplication, improves maintainability, and provides better tooling for debugging subagent workflows.
