I'll analyze the staged changes and create a semantic commit message. Let me first check the current git status and see what changes are staged.

I can see that there are no staged changes to commit - the working tree is clean. This appears to be a case where the git:commit command was invoked but there's nothing to commit.

Since this is from a hook and there are no changes to commit, I should inform you of this situation:

**No changes to commit**

The git status shows:
- Working tree is clean
- No staged changes
- Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 14 commits

There's nothing to commit at this time. If you intended to commit specific changes, you may need to stage them first using `git add`.
