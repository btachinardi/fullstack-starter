I can see that there are currently no staged changes to commit. The working tree is clean, which means either:

1. The changes were already committed
2. There are no changes staged for commit
3. This hook was triggered but the actual commit has already been made

Since this is being called from a SubagentStop hook and the git status shows "nothing to commit, working tree clean", it appears the commit may have already been completed or there are no changes to commit.

Let me check if there are any unstaged changes:

---

## ðŸ”§ Tool: Bash _10:04:52 PM_

**Command:** `git status --short`

## âœ… Tool Result _10:04:55 PM_

There are no changes to commit - the working tree is completely clean. This means:

- No staged changes
- No unstaged changes
- No untracked files

Since this was triggered from a SubagentStop hook but there's nothing to commit, the workflow has likely already completed or no changes were made that need to be committed. No action is needed.
