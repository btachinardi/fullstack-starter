**Command:** `git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
refactor: consolidate slash command docs and restructure tooling

This commit consolidates slash command documentation, restructures the command organization, and enhances the tooling infrastructure:

- Moved slash command guidelines and templates from .claude-code/ to ai/claude/commands/ for centralized documentation
- Reorganized git-commit command into git namespace (.claude/commands/git/commit.md)
- Removed deprecated Python automation scripts (commit-subagent-changes.py, query-subagent-commits scripts)
- Enhanced hook system with improved logging and session parsing capabilities
- Added structured logging service and logs tool for better debugging
- Updated settings to reflect new command structure and organization
- Improved agent creator documentation with latest patterns and conventions

The refactoring improves maintainability by consolidating documentation, removes unused automation scripts in favor of native hooks, and enhances the debugging experience through better logging infrastructure.
