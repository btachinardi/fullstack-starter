Warmup

## ðŸ¤– Assistant _3:21:52 PM_

I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's CLI file search specialist. I'm ready to help you navigate and explore your fullstack-starter codebase.

I can see you're on the `main` branch with a recent addition to `ai/docs/prds/tasks-tool-prd.md`. The repository appears to be an active project with recent commits related to agents refactoring and documentation.

I have access to:
- Glob pattern matching for broad file searches
- Grep for content-based searching with regex
- File reading capabilities
- Bash commands for file operations
- A 200,000 token budget to work with

How can I help you search through your codebase today? I'm ready to find files, search for specific content, or analyze your project structure.

/git:commit

Subagent context (from SubagentStop hook):
- Agent: prd-writer
- Session ID: 0d25a587-2c1f-4110-a6c5-86bca36b400c
- Invocation ID: toolu_0154ggiE24VcWGtw7L37kDmM

Prompt:
Create a comprehensive Product Requirement Document (PRD) for a tasks management tool system based on the request document at `ai/requests/tasks-tool.md`.

The PRD should cover:

**Context:**
- Read the request document at `C:\Users\bruno\Documents\Work\Projects\fullstack-starter\ai\requests\tasks-tool.md`
- This is a new system for managing task documents (*.tasks.md files) in a fullstack project
- The tool will eventually replace the current TodoWrite system with a more sophisticated task management approach

**Key Components to Document:**

1. **Core Tool Functionality:**
   - CLI tool for managing *.tasks.md files
   - Actions: list tasks, get details, start, delete, cancel, complete, reset, add task, list task lists
   - Document scoping (simple name, complete path, partial path)
   - YAML-based task structure with frontmatter

2. **Slash Command & Agent System:**
   - `/tasks:create` slash command
   - research-writer agent (for preliminary research)
   - prd-writer agent integration
   - Rename todo-writer to task-writer
   - New task-validator agent
   - Orchestration workflow

3. **Task Document Format:**
   - Markdown files with YAML frontmatter (title, description, source)
   - YAML task blocks with naming convention `tasks:name`
   - Task fields: id, title, type, project, description, deliverables, requirements, status, depends_on

**Output Requirements:**
- Create the PRD at `ai/docs/prds/tasks-tool-prd.md`
- Include problem statement, user stories, technical requirements, acceptance criteria
- Define clear scope and out-of-scope items
- Specify implementation phases if applicable
- Follow the project's PRD format and conventions

**Important:**
- Make the PRD comprehensive enough to guide the entire implementation
- Include examples from the request document
- Consider integration with existing Claude Code agent system
- Define validation criteria for task documents

Please analyze the staged changes and create an appropriate semantic commit message.
Since this is from a hook, auto-approve and execute the commit without user interaction.

Now I'll create a semantic commit message for this PRD document. Based on the diff, this is a comprehensive Product Requirement Document for a new tasks management tool system. Looking at recent commit history, the project uses semantic commits with format like "docs(agents):", "feat(agents):", etc.

**Command:** `git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
docs(prds): add comprehensive PRD for tasks management tool system

Create detailed product requirement document for the new tasks management 
tool that will replace TodoWrite with a more sophisticated approach using 
*.tasks.md files with YAML frontmatter and structured task blocks.

The PRD covers:
- CLI tool with 9 actions (list, get, start, delete, cancel, complete, 
  reset, add, list-docs)
- Document scoping (simple name, complete path, partial path)
- Task document format with YAML frontmatter and task blocks
- /tasks:create slash command orchestration workflow
- Four specialized agents: research-writer, prd-writer, task-writer, 
  task-validator
- Validation loop for iterative task document refinement
- 7 implementation phases with detailed sub-agent specifications
- User interaction gates and workflow orchestration patterns

This comprehensive PRD provides the foundation for implementing the entire 
tasks management system from research through validation.
