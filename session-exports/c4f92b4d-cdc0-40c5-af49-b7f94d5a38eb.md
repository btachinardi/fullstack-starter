refactor: reorganize slash command infrastructure and improve tooling

Major restructuring of the slash command and agent creation system:

**Slash Command System:**
- Moved slash command guidelines from `.claude-code/` to `ai/claude/commands/`
- Consolidated documentation into canonical locations
- Updated slash-command-creator agent with improved references
- Renamed `/git-commit` to `/git:commit` for better namespace organization

**Tooling Enhancements:**
- Added structured logging service with color support and log levels
- Implemented `/tools logs` CLI command for viewing hook execution logs
- Enhanced subagent-stop hook with better session context handling
- Improved session parser with more robust testing

**Cleanup:**
- Removed deprecated Python commit script and PowerShell query scripts
- Removed obsolete agent creator files from `.claude-code/`
- Deleted test hook files
- Cleaned up ai/scripts directory

This reorganization improves maintainability and provides better developer
experience for working with slash commands and agent hooks.
