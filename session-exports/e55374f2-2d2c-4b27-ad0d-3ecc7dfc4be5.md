Warmup

## ðŸ¤– Assistant _11:02:28 PM_

I'm ready to help! I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI for Claude, and I'm prepared to assist you with file searching and code exploration tasks.

I understand that:
- I'm working in the fullstack-starter project at `C:\Users\bruno\Documents\Work\Projects\fullstack-starter`
- This is a git repository on the main branch
- I should use absolute file paths in my responses
- I have access to Glob, Grep, Read, and Bash tools for file operations
- I should not modify the user's system state
- I should avoid emojis in communication
- There are project instructions available in `@PRINCIPLES.md` and `@RULES.md` that I should follow

I'm ready to help you search for files, explore the codebase, or answer questions about the project structure. What would you like me to help you find or explore?

Subagent context (from SubagentStop hook):
- Agent: subagent-creator
- Session ID: 65618ff3-0cc3-47fa-92f2-b71a63447a1e
- Invocation ID: toolu_01ScAcK5kyKvwTfi6iHZHeox

Prompt:
Create three specialized subagents with the following specifications:

1. **code-writer**
   - Name: code-writer
   - Purpose: Specializes in writing all types of code across different programming languages and frameworks
   - Capabilities: Should be able to write production-ready code following best practices, design patterns, and project conventions. Should handle backend, frontend, scripts, utilities, tests, and any other code artifacts.
   - When to use: When the user needs to write new code, implement features, create functions, or build complete modules

2. **docs-writer**
   - Name: docs-writer
   - Purpose: Specializes in writing all types of documentation
   - Capabilities: Should be able to write technical documentation, API docs, README files, user guides, architecture documents, inline code comments, and any other documentation artifacts. Should follow documentation best practices and maintain clarity.
   - When to use: When the user needs to create or update documentation, explain code, write guides, or document systems

3. **prd-writer**
   - Name: prd-writer
   - Purpose: Specializes in writing Product Requirement Documents (PRDs)
   - Capabilities: Should be able to write comprehensive PRDs including problem statements, user stories, requirements, acceptance criteria, technical specifications, and implementation plans. Should follow industry-standard PRD formats.
   - When to use: When the user needs to plan features, define requirements, or create product specifications

Please create these three subagents following the project templates and best practices. Ensure each agent has appropriate tool access and clear, actionable prompts that guide their specialized behavior.

Please analyze the staged changes and create an appropriate semantic commit message.
Since this is from a hook, auto-approve and execute the commit without user interaction.

feat(agents): add specialized code-writer, docs-writer, and prd-writer agents

Add three new specialized subagents following project templates and best practices:

- code-writer: Production-ready code implementation across all languages/frameworks
  - Full tool access for maximum flexibility
  - 5-phase methodology: context discovery â†’ planning â†’ implementation â†’ validation â†’ documentation
  - Complete feature delivery with no placeholders or TODOs
  - Comprehensive quality standards and validation requirements

- docs-writer: Technical documentation across all formats and audiences
  - Read/Write/Grep/Glob tools for documentation workflows
  - 5-phase approach: audience analysis â†’ planning â†’ writing â†’ enhancement â†’ review
  - Supports API docs, READs, guides, architecture docs, inline comments
  - Audience-focused clarity with technical accuracy

- prd-writer: Product Requirement Documents and feature specifications
  - Read/Write/Grep/Glob tools for planning workflows
  - Structured PRD methodology covering problem â†’ requirements â†’ design â†’ implementation
  - Industry-standard formats with comprehensive templates
  - User story mapping and acceptance criteria definition

All agents use claude-sonnet-4-5 for complex reasoning capabilities and include
autoCommit flags for seamless integration. Each agent provides detailed methodologies,
quality standards, examples, and clear handoff protocols.
