refactor: consolidate slash command resources and enhance hook system

Consolidated slash command documentation by removing duplicate files from .claude-code and keeping canonical versions in ai/claude/commands. Moved git-commit command to namespaced git/commit location for better organization.

Enhanced hook system with improved logging capabilities, adding structured logger service and logs tool. Removed deprecated subagent-specific scripts and test files that are no longer needed. Updated documentation to reflect consolidated structure and improved practices.

Changes:
- Removed duplicate SLASH_COMMAND_GUIDELINES.md and SLASH_COMMAND_TEMPLATE.md from .claude-code
- Removed duplicate agent creators (command-creator.md, subagent-creator.md) from .claude-code
- Updated canonical docs in ai/claude/commands with improved guidelines
- Moved git-commit.md to namespaced git/commit.md
- Added logger service and logs tool for better observability
- Removed deprecated Python and PowerShell scripts for subagent commits
- Updated settings.local.json and tools configuration to reflect new structure
- Enhanced subagent-stop hook with better session handling
