I'll analyze the staged changes and create a semantic commit message. Let me first check the current git status and see what changes are staged.

I can see that there are no staged changes to commit. The working tree is clean and all changes have already been committed. The repository is currently 11 commits ahead of origin/main.

Since this was called from a hook context and there are no staged changes, there's nothing to commit. The most recent commit was:
- `feat(agents): add autoCommit flag and enhance subagent workflow documentation`

If you intended to commit changes, you'll need to stage them first using `git add` before running the commit command.
