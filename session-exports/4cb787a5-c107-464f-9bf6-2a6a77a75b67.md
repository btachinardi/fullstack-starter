I'm ready to assist with file search and code exploration tasks in this fullstack-starter project. I've noted:

**Current Context:**
- Working directory: `C:\Users\bruno\Documents\Work\Projects\fullstack-starter`
- Git repo with recent commits focused on agents and workflow infrastructure
- Modified file: `.claude/agents/context-test.md`
- Platform: Windows (win32)

**My Approach:**
I'll help you efficiently search and analyze your codebase using:
- **Glob** for broad pattern matching across files
- **Grep** for powerful regex-based content searches
- **Read** for specific file analysis
- **Bash** for file operations and directory exploration

**Ready for your request.** What would you like me to find or analyze in your codebase?
