/git:commit

Subagent context (from SubagentStop hook):
- Agent: subagent-creator
- Session ID: 65618ff3-0cc3-47fa-92f2-b71a63447a1e
- Invocation ID: toolu_013WcHQYipuKJRcJnWV8D8Qj

Prompt:
Create a specialized subagent with the following specification:

**test-debugger**
- Name: test-debugger
- Purpose: Runs all project tests, identifies failures, and fixes them iteratively until all tests pass
- Capabilities:
  - Discovers and runs all test suites in the project
  - Analyzes test failure messages and stack traces
  - Identifies root causes of test failures
  - Fixes one failing test at a time systematically
  - Re-runs tests after each fix to verify and identify next failure
  - Continues iteration until all tests pass
  - Handles unit, integration, and e2e test failures
  - Preserves existing test coverage and functionality
- Tools needed: All tools (needs to read code/tests, edit files, run test commands)
- Workflow: Run tests â†’ Identify failure â†’ Fix root cause â†’ Re-run â†’ Repeat until all pass
- When to use: When tests are failing, after refactoring, or before releases
- Success criteria: All test suites pass with 100% success rate

Please create this subagent following project templates and best practices.

Please analyze the staged changes and create an appropriate semantic commit message.
Since this is from a hook, auto-approve and execute the commit without user interaction.

I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's CLI file search specialist. I'm ready to help you navigate and explore your codebase efficiently.

I can see you're working in a fullstack-starter project on the main branch. The repository has some recently added agent files and configurations related to specialized code writers, documentation writers, and PRD writers.

I'm equipped to:
- **Search files** using glob patterns for broad matching
- **Search content** using regex patterns for precise text finding
- **Read files** when you know the exact path
- **Execute file operations** like listing directories or copying files

What would you like me to search for or explore in your codebase? Just let me know:
1. What you're looking for (files, code patterns, content)
2. How thorough you'd like the search to be
3. Any specific areas or file types you want me to focus on

I'm ready to help whenever you have a search request!

I can see there are no staged changes to commit - the working tree is clean. This appears to be running from a hook after the subagent-creator has already completed its work and committed the changes.

Let me check if there are any uncommitted changes or if this is a post-commit hook scenario:

commit a4c3a6d17c874a929a06df2a8a8dd2d96e662ed0
Author: Bruno Tachinardi <bruno@fofuuu.com>
Date:   Mon Oct 20 23:22:02 2025 -0300

    feat(agents): add specialized planning, research, and validation agents
    
    Add five new specialized agents organized by domain:
    - todo-writer: Generates comprehensive todo documents from PRDs and feature specs
    - research-writer: Conducts technical research and creates structured research documents
    - test-writer: Creates comprehensive test suite

... (truncated)
```

Perfect! I can see that the test-debugger agent has already been created and committed as part of the most recent commit. The commit includes:

- **test-debugger.md** in `.claude/agents/validation/` directory (466 lines)
- Along with other specialized agents (todo-writer, research-writer, test-writer, lint-debugger)

The commit message follows the semantic commit format:
- **Type**: `feat(agents)` - adding new agent features
- **Description**: Clearly describes the addition of specialized planning, research, and validation agents
- **Body**: Lists all five agents with their purposes

Since the work has already been committed and there are no additional changes to commit, the task is complete. The test-debugger agent was successfully created and committed with an appropriate semantic commit message.
