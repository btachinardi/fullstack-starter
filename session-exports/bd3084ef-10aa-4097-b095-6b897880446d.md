## 👤 User _11:06:23 AM_

Create a new subagent called "ci-debugger" in the `.claude/agents/validation/` directory, similar to the existing `lint-debugger.md` and `test-debugger.md` agents.

**Agent Requirements:**

**Name:** ci-debugger
**Description:** Runs the full CI pipeline using `pnpm ci:local`, identifies all types of failures (bootstrap, lint, typecheck, test, build, security), and systematically fixes them until the entire CI pipeline passes.

**Model:** claude-sonnet-4-5 (requires complex reasoning across multiple failure types)
**autoCommit:** true

**Context to incorporate:**
1. The CI script location: `scripts/ci-local.sh`
2. The CI jobs that run (in order):
   - Setup / Bootstrap Check: `pnpm ci:bootstrap`
   - Lint: `pnpm turbo run lint --filter='./packages/*' --filter='./apps/*'`
   - Type Check: `pnpm turbo run typecheck --filter='./packages/*' --filter='./apps/*'`
   - Test: `pnpm turbo run test --filter='./packages/*' --filter='./apps/*'`
   - Build: `pnpm turbo run build`
   - Security / Gitleaks (optional if installed)
   - Security / SBOM (optional if installed)

**Agent Structure:**
Follow the same structure as lint-debugger.md and test-debugger.md:
- Core Directive
- Configuration Notes (model selection, tool access)
- Available Tools section
- Methodology with 5 phases:
  - Phase 1: CI Job Discovery and Initial Run
  - Phase 2: Failure Analysis (categorize by job type)
  - Phase 3: Fix Implementation (systematic fixing)
  - Phase 4: Verification and Iteration
  - Phase 5: Final Validation
- Quality Standards
- Communication Protocol with progress updates and final report format
- Behavioral Guidelines (decision-making, safety, scope management)
- Error Handling (when blocked, uncertain, complete)
- Examples & Patterns (at least 3 examples)
- Integration & Delegation
- Success Metrics

**Key Differences from lint-debugger:**
- This agent handles ALL CI job types, not just linting
- Must handle dependencies between jobs (e.g., can't build if types fail)
- Should prioritize fixes based on job order (fix bootstrap before lint, etc.)
- Should recognize when to delegate to specialized agents (lint-debugger for lint issues, test-debugger for test issues)
- Must handle the full CI environment simulation (CI=true, GITHUB_ACTIONS=true)
- Should check for optional security tools and skip gracefully if not installed

**Special Considerations:**
- The ci-local.sh script uses `set -e` to stop on first failure by default
- Can set `CI_FAIL_FAST=true` to stop immediately on first failure
- Should explain the difference between running individual jobs vs. full CI pipeline
- Should validate that pnpm-lock.yaml exists before running
- Should run `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` as part of the process

Please create this agent following the same high-quality, comprehensive structure as the existing validation agents.

✅ **Phase 5 Complete: CI Debugger Agent Created Successfully**

---

## Summary

Created comprehensive ci-debugger agent: **ci-debugger**

- **Purpose:** Runs the full CI pipeline using `pnpm ci:local`, identifies all types of failures (bootstrap, lint, typecheck, test, build, security), and systematically fixes them until the entire CI pipeline passes
- **Location:** `C:\Users\bruno\Documents\Work\Projects\fullstack-starter\.claude\agents\validation\ci-debugger.md`
- **Tools:** All tools (inherited) - Full access for comprehensive CI debugging
- **Model:** claude-sonnet-4-5 (requires complex reasoning across multiple failure types)
- **autoCommit:** true

## Agent Capabilities

- **Multi-Job CI Debugging**: Handles all CI job types (bootstrap, lint, typecheck, test, build, security)
- **Dependency-Aware Fixing**: Fixes jobs in priority order respecting dependencies (bootstrap → types → lint → test → build → security)
- **Intelligent Delegation**: Delegates to specialized agents when appropriate (lint-debugger for >50 lint errors, test-debugger for >10 test failures)
- **Iterative Validation**: Re-runs CI after each job type is fixed to verify resolution and identify remaining failures
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Categorizes failures, identifies root causes, and maps dependencies between failures
- **Full CI Simulation**: Uses `pnpm ci:local` to simulate GitHub Actions environment with `CI=true` and `GITHUB_ACTIONS=true`

## Key Features

### 5-Phase Methodology
1. **CI Job Discovery and Initial Run**: Identify all jobs, run full pipeline, categorize failures
2. **Failure Analysis**: Analyze each job type, identify root causes, determine delegation strategy
3. **Fix Implementation**: Systematically fix jobs in priority order, delegate when appropriate
4. **Verification and Iteration**: Re-run CI, track progress, iterate until all pass
5. **Final Validation**: Confirm 100% success, validate build artifacts, generate comprehensive report

### Intelligent Delegation Strategy
- **Lint-debugger**: When lint >50 errors OR typecheck >20 errors
- **Test-debugger**: When tests >10 failures OR complex debugging needed
- **Direct fixing**: Bootstrap, build, security issues (no specialized agents)

### Priority-Based Fix Order
1. **Priority 1**: Bootstrap (blocks everything)
2. **Priority 2**: Type Check (blocks build)
3. **Priority 3**: Lint (quality gate)
4. **Priority 4**: Test (functionality validation)
5. **Priority 5**: Build (deployment readiness)
6. **Priority 6**: Security (compliance)

## Invocation

To use this agent:

```
Task: subagent_type="ci-debugger", prompt="Run the full CI pipeline and fix all failures until everything passes"
```

### Example Invocations

**Basic CI debugging:**
```
Task: subagent_type="ci-debugger", prompt="Run pnpm ci:local and fix all CI failures. The pipeline is currently failing on multiple jobs."
```

**After major refactoring:**
```
Task: subagent_type="ci-debugger", prompt="Validate that all CI jobs pass after the recent refactoring. Fix any failures in bootstrap, lint, typecheck, test, or build jobs."
```

**Before release:**
```
Task: subagent_type="ci-debugger", prompt="Run complete CI validation before release. Ensure all quality gates pass including security checks."
```

**Specific job focus:**
```
Task: subagent_type="ci-debugger", prompt="CI is failing on build job. Run the full pipeline and fix build failures along with any upstream dependencies (types, lint)."
```

## Differences from Lint-Debugger and Test-Debugger

| Feature | ci-debugger | lint-debugger | test-debugger |
|---------|-------------|---------------|---------------|
| **Scope** | Full CI pipeline (all jobs) | Lint + typecheck only | Tests only |
| **Jobs Handled** | Bootstrap, Lint, Types, Test, Build, Security | Lint, TypeScript | Unit, Integration, E2E tests |
| **Delegation** | ✅ Delegates to lint-debugger and test-debugger | ❌ No delegation | ❌ No delegation |
| **Priority** | Job dependency order | Error type priority | Failure priority |
| **Environment** | CI simulation (CI=true) | Dev environment | Test environment |
| **Entry Point** | `pnpm ci:local` | `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck` | `pnpm test` |

## Next Steps

1. **Test the agent** with a real CI failure scenario
2. **Verify delegation** to lint-debugger and test-debugger works correctly
3. **Validate** that the agent handles all CI job types appropriately
4. **Monitor** performance and iteration count for large failure sets
5. **Refine** thresholds for delegation (>50 lint, >10 test) based on real usage

## Related Agents

- **lint-debugger**: Specialized agent for fixing linting and type-checking errors (delegated to by ci-debugger)
- **test-debugger**: Specialized agent for debugging and fixing test failures (delegated to by ci-debugger)
- **commit-grouper**: Use after ci-debugger to organize CI fixes into logical commits
- **general-purpose**: For overall project coordination and next steps after CI passes

## File Structure Consistency

The agent follows the exact same structure as lint-debugger and test-debugger:
- ✅ YAML frontmatter with all required fields
- ✅ Core Directive section with "When to Use" scenarios
- ✅ Configuration Notes with tool access and model selection rationale
- ✅ 5-phase methodology with objectives, steps, outputs, and validation
- ✅ Quality Standards with completeness criteria
- ✅ Communication Protocol with progress updates and final report format
- ✅ Behavioral Guidelines
- ✅ Error Handling (when blocked, uncertain, complete)
- ✅ Examples & Patterns (4 comprehensive examples)
- ✅ Integration & Delegation section
- ✅ Success Metrics
- ✅ Metadata footer

The ci-debugger agent is production-ready and follows all project standards and best practices!

Create a new slash command called `/dev:validate` that orchestrates all validation subagents to check and fix all problems in the project.

**Command Requirements:**

**Name:** `/dev:validate`
**Location:** `.claude/commands/dev/validate.md` (create the dev/ subdirectory if it doesn't exist)

**Purpose:**
A comprehensive validation command that runs all project quality checks and systematically fixes all issues. This command orchestrates the three validation agents (lint-debugger, test-debugger, ci-debugger) to ensure the entire project is in a clean, committable state.

**Workflow:**
The command should follow this orchestration pattern:

1. **Initial Assessment Phase:**
   - Run quick checks to identify which areas have issues
   - Determine which agents need to be invoked based on failures
   - Provide user with a summary of what will be fixed

2. **Systematic Fixing Phase (in priority order):**
   - **Option A (Full CI approach - RECOMMENDED):** 
     - Invoke the `ci-debugger` agent which handles everything (bootstrap, lint, typecheck, test, build, security)
     - The ci-debugger will automatically delegate to lint-debugger and test-debugger when appropriate
     - This ensures all jobs pass in the correct dependency order
   
   - **Option B (Individual agents approach):**
     - First invoke `lint-debugger` agent to fix all linting and type-checking issues
     - Then invoke `test-debugger` agent to fix all test failures
     - Finally run `pnpm build` to ensure project builds successfully
     - This is faster but doesn't validate the full CI pipeline

3. **Final Validation Phase:**
   - Run `pnpm ci:local` to confirm everything passes
   - Provide comprehensive summary of all fixes applied
   - Suggest next steps (commit, create PR, etc.)

**Behavior:**
- Should be autonomous - fix issues without asking unless critical decisions needed
- Should provide clear progress updates throughout the process
- Should track all changes made for the final summary
- Should fail gracefully if any agent encounters unrecoverable errors
- Should suggest using `/git:commit` after successful validation

**User Experience:**
```
> /dev:validate

🔍 Running validation checks across the project...

📊 Assessment Complete:
- Linting: 47 errors found
- Type Checking: 23 errors found  
- Tests: 5 failures found
- Build: Not validated yet

🚀 Starting systematic validation and fixing...

[Agent orchestration happens here with progress updates]

✅ Validation Complete!

📈 Summary:
- Fixed 47 linting errors across 12 files
- Fixed 23 type errors across 8 files
- Fixed 5 test failures across 3 test suites
- Build successful - all artifacts generated
- CI pipeline: 100% passing

🎯 Next Steps:
- Your project is now in a clean, committable state
- Consider running /git:commit to commit these fixes
- All quality gates are passing
```

**Command Style:**
- Use the Task tool to invoke agents (don't use SlashCommand or Skill)
- Follow the pattern from other commands in the project
- Include clear section headers and progress indicators
- Be concise but informative
- Focus on the orchestration logic, let agents do the heavy lifting

**Special Considerations:**
- Default to **Option A (ci-debugger)** as it's more comprehensive
- Mention Option B exists for faster iterations during development
- Handle the case where everything already passes (early exit with success message)
- If CI environment tools are missing (gitleaks, cyclonedx), mention but don't fail
- Should work in both monorepo and single-project setups

**Integration:**
- This command should be the "go-to" command before any commit
- Works well with `/git:commit` command (run validate first, then commit)
- Can be used as a pre-commit hook validation step
- Useful for ensuring PR readiness

Please create this command following project conventions and best practices for slash commands.

## 🤖 Assistant _11:23:07 AM_

Perfect! I've successfully created the `/dev:validate` command. Let me provide you with a comprehensive summary:

## Summary

Created slash command: `/dev:validate`
- **Purpose:** Orchestrate all validation agents to check and systematically fix all project issues until CI passes
- **Complexity:** Comprehensive (multi-phase workflow command)
- **Location:** `.claude\commands\dev\validate.md`
- **Template Pattern:** Workflow command pattern with agent orchestration

## Command Capabilities

The `/dev:validate` command provides:
- **Complete project validation** by running the full CI pipeline locally
- **Intelligent orchestration** of specialized validation agents (ci-debugger, lint-debugger, test-debugger)
- **Flexible strategies** - choose between full CI validation (comprehensive) or individual agents (faster)
- **Systematic fixing** of all issues: bootstrap, lint, typecheck, test, build, and security
- **Progress tracking** throughout the validation and fixing process
- **Comprehensive reporting** of all fixes applied and final CI status

## Invocation

To use this command, type in Claude Code chat:
```
/dev:validate
```

The command will expand to a detailed prompt that:
- Runs initial CI assessment to identify failing jobs
- Recommends appropriate validation strategy (full CI vs. individual agents)
- Orchestrates specialized agents to fix issues systematically
- Re-runs CI to confirm 100% success rate
- Provides comprehensive summary of all fixes

## Example Usage Scenario

**Before committing code after major refactoring:**

User types: `/dev:validate`

Result: Claude Code:
1. Runs `pnpm ci:local` to assess project health
2. Finds 47 lint errors, 23 type errors, 5 test failures
3. Recommends using ci-debugger (Option A) for comprehensive validation
4. Invokes ci-debugger agent which:
   - Delegates to lint-debugger for lint/type fixes
   - Delegates to test-debugger for test fixes
   - Handles build and security validation
5. Re-runs complete CI pipeline
6. Reports 100% success with summary of all fixes
7. Suggests `/git:commit` as next step

The entire project is now validated and ready to commit/push with confidence that CI will pass in GitHub Actions.

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test with clean project**: Run `/dev:validate` on a project that already passes all checks to verify early-exit behavior
2. **Test with lint failures**: Introduce some lint errors and verify the command orchestrates lint-debugger appropriately
3. **Test with test failures**: Break a test and verify test-debugger is invoked and fixes the issue
4. **Test with multiple failures**: Introduce failures across multiple job types and verify ci-debugger orchestrates correctly
5. **Verify final CI run**: Ensure the command always runs final `pnpm ci:local` validation
6. **Check reporting**: Verify comprehensive summary includes all fixes and agent delegation details

## Related Commands

- **`/git:commit`**: Use after `/dev:validate` to commit the fixes with proper semantic messages
- **`/format`**: Quick formatting command (subset of what validate does)

## Next Steps

1. Test the command with a real scenario (introduce some lint errors or break a test)
2. Verify the command correctly delegates to validation agents
3. Ensure the final report is comprehensive and actionable
4. Consider adding to project documentation as the standard pre-commit validation workflow
5. Integrate into team workflow - recommend running before every commit or PR

---

The command follows all project standards:
- ✅ YAML frontmatter with description, allowed-tools, and model
- ✅ Comprehensive template structure (Objective, Context, Instructions with Phases, Output Format, Quality Standards, Constraints, Examples)
- ✅ Clear delegation to specialized agents (ci-debugger, lint-debugger, test-debugger)
- ✅ Workflow command pattern with orchestration focus
- ✅ Two validation strategies (Option A: Full CI, Option B: Individual agents)
- ✅ Examples showing different scenarios
- ✅ Integration guidance with git workflow
- ✅ Related commands documented

Your validation orchestrator is ready to use! 🚀

---

## 🤖 Assistant _11:24:12 AM_

Perfect! I've successfully completed your request. Here's what was created:

## ✅ Created CI Debugger Agent

**Location:** `.claude/agents/validation/ci-debugger.md`

This agent runs the full CI pipeline (`pnpm ci:local`) and systematically fixes all types of failures:
- Bootstrap checks
- Linting errors
- Type-checking errors  
- Test failures
- Build issues
- Security checks

**Key Features:**
- Intelligently delegates to `lint-debugger` (when >50 lint errors) and `test-debugger` (when >10 test failures)
- Fixes issues in dependency order (bootstrap → types → lint → test → build → security)
- Simulates the full GitHub Actions CI environment
- Provides comprehensive reporting of all fixes

## ✅ Created /dev:validate Command

**Location:** `.claude/commands/dev/validate.md`

This command orchestrates all validation agents to ensure your entire project is in a clean, committable state.

**Two Validation Strategies:**
- **Option A (Recommended):** Use `ci-debugger` for comprehensive full-pipeline validation
- **Option B (Faster):** Use individual agents (`lint-debugger` → `test-debugger` → build check)

**Usage:**
```
/dev:validate
```

The command will automatically assess your project, choose the best strategy, orchestrate the appropriate agents, and provide a comprehensive summary of all fixes.

## 🚀 Ready to Use

Your validation workflow is now complete:
1. Run `/dev:validate` before committing to ensure everything passes
2. The command will fix all issues automatically
3. Use `/git:commit` afterward to commit the fixes

This gives you a robust, automated quality gate for your entire project! 🎯
