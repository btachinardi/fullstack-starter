## ðŸ¤– Assistant _4:39:02 PM_

I'm Claude Code, ready to assist with file search and navigation tasks in your fullstack-starter project.

I've reviewed the context:
- **Working directory**: C:\Users\bruno\Documents\Work\Projects\fullstack-starter
- **Git repo**: Yes, on main branch
- **Modified files**: README.md, several PRD documents
- **New directories**: .claude-code/, .claude/, claudedocs/, docs/prd/agents/

I understand your principles (Evidence > Assumptions, Task-First approach, parallel thinking) and rules (safety first, scope discipline, quality checks, no partial features).

I'm equipped to:
- Search using **Glob** for file patterns
- Search using **Grep** for code content with regex
- **Read** specific files
- Run **Bash** for safe file operations
- Batch operations efficiently and parallelize where possible

Ready for your search request. What would you like me to find or explore?
