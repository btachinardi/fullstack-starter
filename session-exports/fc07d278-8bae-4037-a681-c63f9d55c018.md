Based on the staged changes, I can see this is a significant update to the subagent infrastructure, adding support for auto-commit functionality and subagent context/instructions. Let me create an appropriate semantic commit message:

feat(agents): add auto-commit support and subagent context framework

Enhance subagent infrastructure with automatic commit capabilities and standardized context injection:

- Add autoCommit flag to agent frontmatter (analysis-plan-executor, slash-command-creator, subagent-creator, permissions-optimizer)
- Create SUBAGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md for standardized subagent context and guidelines
- Add context-test agent for testing subagent context injection
- Update git:commit command with comprehensive delegation workflow to commit-grouper and commit-message-generator subagents
- Enhance subagent-stop hook to detect and include agent metadata in commits
- Update SUBAGENT_GUIDELINES.md and SUBAGENT_TEMPLATE.md with new patterns
- Set autoCommit: false for commit-message-generator and empty agent (these should not auto-commit)

This establishes a foundation for autonomous subagent workflows where certain agents can automatically commit their work with proper metadata tracking.
