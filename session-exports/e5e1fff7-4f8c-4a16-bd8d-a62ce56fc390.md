Warmup

## ðŸ¤– Assistant _10:04:45 PM_

I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI for Claude. I'm ready to help you search and explore your codebase efficiently.

I can see you're working in a fullstack-starter project that's a git repository on the main branch. I notice there's a modified file (`.claude/commands/git/commit.md`) and recent commits related to agents, workflows, and security features.

I'm prepared to:
- Search for files using glob patterns
- Find content using regex patterns
- Read and analyze specific files
- Help you navigate and understand your codebase

What would you like me to search for or explore in your project?

There are no staged changes to commit. The working tree is clean. Since this was invoked from a hook and there's nothing to commit, I'll report this status:

**Status:** No changes to commit. The working tree is clean and all changes are already committed.

Your branch is currently 13 commits ahead of 'origin/main'. If you'd like to push these commits, you can run `git push`.
