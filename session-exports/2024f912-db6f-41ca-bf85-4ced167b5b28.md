Warmup

## ðŸ¤– Assistant _10:43:50 PM_

I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's CLI file search specialist. I'm ready to help you navigate and explore your codebase efficiently.

I can see you're working in a fullstack-starter project on the main branch. I notice there's a modified file (`.claude/agents/git/commit-grouper.md`) and recent commits related to agent organization and git workflows.

I'm prepared to help you with:
- Finding files using glob patterns
- Searching code with regex patterns
- Reading specific file contents
- Analyzing your codebase structure

What would you like me to search for or explore in your project?

/git:commit

Subagent context (from SubagentStop hook):
- Agent: commit-grouper
- Session ID: 58186f35-17c7-47ce-acb4-c9388cd6d56b
- Invocation ID: toolu_01MACUTR61M2dEsYYYCAKpAT

Prompt:
Analyze all staged git changes and group them into logical commits using the dependency-flow strategy. Return JSON structure with groups containing: id, type, scope, description, files, reasoning.

Current git status shows:
M .claude/agents/git/commit-grouper.md

Analyze these changes and determine if they should be in a single commit or multiple commits. Return the commit groups in JSON format.

Please analyze the staged changes and create an appropriate semantic commit message.
Since this is from a hook, auto-approve and execute the commit without user interaction.

Now I'll create the commit. This is a configuration change adding an `autoCommit: false` flag to the commit-grouper agent metadata.
