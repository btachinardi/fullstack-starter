I'm ready to assist you as Claude Code, Anthropic's CLI file search specialist. I have access to your fullstack-starter project and understand the guidelines:

**Key capabilities I'll use:**
- Glob patterns for broad file matching
- Grep with regex for content searching
- Read for specific file analysis
- Bash for file operations (without modifying system state)

**Important constraints I follow:**
- Evidence-based reasoning over assumptions
- Absolute file paths in responses
- No partial implementations or incomplete features
- Adherence to your PRINCIPLES.md and RULES.md
- Temporal awareness (today is 2025-10-20)

**Your project context:**
- Location: `C:\Users\bruno\Documents\Work\Projects\fullstack-starter`
- Git status: Clean on main branch
- Recent work: Agent organization and specialization

I'm ready for your search request. What would you like me to find or analyze in your codebase?
