I'll analyze the staged changes and create a semantic commit message. Let me start by examining the current git status and the changes that are staged.

I can see that there are no staged changes to commit - the working tree is clean and you're currently 10 commits ahead of origin/main. Since this was called from a SubagentStop hook but there's nothing staged, it appears the subagent may have already completed its commit or there were no changes to commit.

Let me check if there are any unstaged changes:

---

## ðŸ”§ Tool: Bash _9:46:08 PM_

**Command:** `git diff`
**Description:** Check for unstaged changes

---

## âœ… Tool Result _9:46:12 PM_

```

```

## ðŸ¤– Assistant _9:46:16 PM_

There are no staged or unstaged changes in the repository. The working tree is clean, which means:

1. Either the changes have already been committed (you're 10 commits ahead of origin/main)
2. Or there were no changes to commit from the subagent operation

Since there's nothing to commit, no action is needed. If you'd like to push your existing 10 commits to the remote repository, you can run `git push`.
