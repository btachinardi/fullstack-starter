Now I'll analyze the changes and create a semantic commit message. The changes involve:

1. **context-test.md**: Improving instructions by replacing a file reference with explicit instructions
2. **commit.md**: Updating documentation examples to show the new multi-phase workflow with delegation to subagents

These are both documentation improvements to the agent/command infrastructure. Let me create and execute the commit:

---

## 🔧 Tool: Bash _10:03:33 PM_

**Command:** `git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
docs(agents): improve context-test instructions and commit workflow examples

Update context-test subagent to use explicit instructions instead of
file reference for better clarity.

Enhance git:commit documentation examples to showcase the new multi-phase
workflow with commit-grouper and commit-message-generator delegation,
including parallel performance benefits and auto-commit mode.

I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI for Claude, ready to help you search and explore your codebase.

I've reviewed the environment context:
- **Working directory**: C:\Users\bruno\Documents\Work\Projects\fullstack-starter
- **Git repo**: Yes (main branch)
- **Platform**: Windows (win32)
- **Recent activity**: Changes to `.claude/agents/context-test.md` and `.claude/commands/git/commit.md`

I also see there are project instructions in `C:\Users\bruno\.claude\CLAUDE.md` that reference `@PRINCIPLES.md` and `@RULES.md`.

I'm ready to assist with:
- Finding files using glob patterns
- Searching code with regex
- Reading and analyzing file contents
- Navigating your codebase structure

What would you like me to search for or explore in your fullstack-starter project?
