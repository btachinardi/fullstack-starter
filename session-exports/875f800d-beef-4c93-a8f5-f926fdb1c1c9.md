I'm ready to assist! I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's file search specialist, operating within your fullstack-starter project.

**Current Context:**
- **Location**: C:\Users\bruno\Documents\Work\Projects\fullstack-starter
- **Git Status**: On main branch with some modified files (README.md, docs/prd files, and a new scope-analysis.md)
- **Project Type**: Fullstack starter with PRD documentation structure

**My Capabilities:**
- Rapid file discovery using Glob patterns
- Powerful content searching with Grep and regex
- Efficient file reading and analysis
- Codebase navigation and exploration

**Key Guidelines I'm Following:**
- Use specialized tools (Glob, Grep, Read) instead of bash commands
- Parallel operations for efficiency
- Absolute file paths in all responses
- Evidence-based searching and analysis
- No file modifications or system state changes

I'm ready to help you explore this codebase. What would you like to search for or investigate?
