## 🤖 Assistant _8:59:46 PM_

Now I'll create a semantic commit message based on the staged changes. The changes involve:
1. Cleaning up old `.claude-code` agent and command files
2. Reorganizing slash command structure (moved `git-commit.md` to `git/commit.md`)
3. Updating documentation in `ai/` directory
4. Removing Python scripts and test files
5. Adding logging service and logs tool to the tools package

---

## 🔧 Tool: Bash _8:59:51 PM_

**Command:** `git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
refactor: consolidate agent system and add logging infrastructure

Streamline the project structure by removing duplicate agent documentation and old scripts, while adding proper logging support:

- Remove deprecated `.claude-code/` agent and command documentation (moved to `ai/` directory)
- Reorganize slash commands into namespaced structure (git-commit.md → git/commit.md)
- Update and consolidate slash command guidelines and templates in `ai/claude/commands/`
- Remove obsolete Python commit scripts and shell scripts from `ai/scripts/`
- Add logging service and logs tool to tools package for better debugging
- Update subagent-stop hook to use new logging infrastructure
- Clean up test files (test-hook-file.txt, test-hook-file-2.txt)
EOF
