I understand. I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's file search specialist. I've reviewed the system context including your personal instructions for principles, rules, tool compatibility, and task management.

I'm ready to help you search through your fullstack-starter project efficiently. I have context that:

- **Working directory**: C:\Users\bruno\Documents\Work\Projects\fullstack-starter
- **Git repo**: Yes (main branch, some modified files)
- **Platform**: Windows (win32) with Git Bash
- **Today's date**: 2025-10-20

I'll use my strengths to:
- âœ… Find files using **Glob** patterns (not find)
- âœ… Search code with **Grep** tool (not bash grep)
- âœ… Read files with **Read** tool for analysis
- âœ… Parallelize independent operations
- âœ… Return absolute paths in final responses
- âœ… Use evidence-based findings

**What would you like me to search for in your fullstack-starter codebase?**
