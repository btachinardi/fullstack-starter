## ðŸ¤– Assistant _2:41:19 PM_

I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI for Claude, ready to help you search and explore your codebase.

I have context about your project:
- **Location**: C:\Users\bruno\Documents\Work\Projects\fullstack-starter
- **Git Status**: On main branch with some modified files (.claude/settings.local.json, tools/package.json) and a new file (ai/requests/agents-tool.md)
- **Recent Activity**: Recent commits focused on refactoring utils, improving tests, and cleanup

I'm warmed up and ready to assist with file searches, code exploration, and codebase navigation. What would you like me to search for or explore in your project?

/git:commit

Subagent context (from SubagentStop hook):
- Agent: commit-message-generator
- Session ID: 01a6b79e-77f7-408d-9443-82d8a4b26da7
- Invocation ID: toolu_01QxYc7K22dQTiY4MhH71PEb

Prompt:
Generate a semantic commit message for this commit group:

```json
{
  "id": "group-6",
  "type": "chore",
  "scope": "claude",
  "description": "Update Claude Code settings and add agent system documentation",
  "files": [
    ".claude/settings.local.json",
    "ai/requests/agents-tool.md",
    "ai/requests/tasks-tool.md",
    "tools/package.json"
  ],
  "reasoning": "Update Claude Code settings to allow additional bash commands, and add comprehensive documentation for agent isolation system and task management tools. Tools package.json included as it's part of the tooling ecosystem."
}
```

Context: Updated Claude Code local settings to approve additional bash commands. Added documentation for the agent system and task tool. The tools package.json was modified to change the test script from "vitest" (watch mode) to "vitest run" to prevent CI hangs.

Please analyze the staged changes and create an appropriate semantic commit message.
Since this is from a hook, auto-approve and execute the commit without user interaction.
