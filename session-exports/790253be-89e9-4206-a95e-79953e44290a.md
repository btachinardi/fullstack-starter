Now I'll create a semantic commit message based on the changes. This appears to be a significant refactoring that reorganizes the project structure, removes deprecated agent scaffolding, enhances the subagent system with logging capabilities, and consolidates documentation.

## 🔧 Tool: Bash _8:57:50 PM_

**Command:** `git add -A && git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
refactor: consolidate agent system and enhance subagent tooling

Major restructuring of the agent creation system and subagent infrastructure:

- Remove deprecated .claude-code agent scaffolding (command-creator, subagent-creator)
- Reorganize slash commands (git-commit.md → git/commit.md namespace)
- Consolidate slash command documentation in ai/claude/commands
- Update agent creator to reference new documentation locations
- Enhance subagent-stop hook with structured logging system
- Add new logger service and logs tool for session analysis
- Improve session parser with comprehensive test coverage
- Update tools package dependencies (pnpm-lock.yaml)

This change streamlines the agent creation workflow and provides better observability into subagent operations through the new logging infrastructure.
