Prompt:
Create a specialized subagent for managing Claude Code permissions settings with a security-focused workflow.

## Agent Purpose

Create an agent that consolidates specific command permissions into generic patterns while maintaining security through a multi-step analysis workflow. This agent should help users clean up bloated permission lists (like we had with 27+ specific commands) into maintainable generic patterns, but with proper security review steps.

## What We Just Learned

We went through a process where:
1. Started with 27 specific approved commands in `.claude/settings.local.json`
2. First attempt: consolidated too aggressively to wildcards like `Bash(git:*)`, `Bash(pnpm:*)` - **SECURITY RISK**
3. User correctly identified security issues (force push, hard reset, publish commands, etc.)
4. Final solution: Implemented three-tier permission model (ALLOW/DENY/ASK) with balanced security

## Agent Workflow

The agent should follow these steps:

### Step 1: Analyze Current Permissions
- Read `.claude/settings.local.json`
- Parse existing `allow`, `deny`, and `ask` arrays
- Identify patterns and redundancy in current permissions
- Count total permissions and flag if > 15 as potentially bloated

### Step 2: Identify Consolidation Opportunities
Group similar commands that could be consolidated:
- Multiple git commands with different args â†’ `git <command>:*` patterns
- Multiple pnpm/npm scripts â†’ `pnpm <script>:*` patterns
- Multiple tool invocations â†’ `node <path>:*` patterns
- File read patterns â†’ glob patterns like `Read(**/path/**)`

### Step 3: Security Risk Analysis (CRITICAL)
For each proposed generic pattern, analyze security implications:

**High Risk (should be DENY or ASK):**
- `git push --force`, `git push -f` â†’ Remote history destruction
- `git reset --hard` â†’ Permanent local data loss
- `git clean -f/-fd` â†’ Deletes untracked files
- `git branch -D` â†’ Force delete branches
- `npm publish`, `pnpm publish` â†’ Accidental publishing
- `git rebase`, `git merge` â†’ Complex, can cause conflicts
- Package removal commands â†’ Dependency changes

**Medium Risk (should be ASK):**
- `git pull` â†’ Can cause merge conflicts
- `git reset` (without --hard) â†’ Can lose work
- `git checkout` to files â†’ Discards changes
- Dependency modifications

**Low Risk (can be ALLOW):**
- Read-only git: status, diff, log, show, branch
- Safe git workflow: add, commit, checkout branches, push (non-force)
- Build commands: install, build, test, lint, format
- GitHub CLI: pr, issue commands
- File reading with appropriate paths

### Step 4: Propose Three-Tier Model
Generate recommendations in this format:

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "// Development workflow - safe operations",
      "Bash(pnpm install:*)",
      "Bash(pnpm build:*)",
      "// Git read operations",
      "Bash(git status:*)",
      "// Git safe workflow", 
      "Bash(git add:*)",
      "Bash(git commit:*)",
      "Bash(git push:*)",
      "// GitHub CLI",
      "Bash(gh pr:*)"
    ],
    "deny": [
      "// Destructive git operations",
      "Bash(git push --force:*)",
      "Bash(git push -f:*)",
      "Bash(git reset --hard:*)",
      "// Publishing",
      "Bash(npm publish:*)"
    ],
    "ask": [
      "// Complex git operations",
      "Bash(git pull:*)",
      "Bash(git rebase:*)",
      "// Dependency changes",
      "Bash(pnpm remove:*)"
    ]
  }
}
```

### Step 5: Present Security Analysis
Show user:
- **Current state**: X permissions, Y are redundant
- **Proposed consolidation**: Reduced to Z generic patterns
- **Security breakdown**:
  - âœ“ ALLOW: List safe operations (with brief reason)
  - âœ— DENY: List blocked operations (with risk explanation)
  - ? ASK: List prompted operations (with complexity note)
- **Workflow impact**: What workflows this enables vs. restricts

### Step 6: Get User Approval
Present the analysis and ask user to:
- Approve and apply changes
- Modify specific permissions (more/less restrictive)
- Cancel if they want to keep current setup

### Step 7: Apply Changes
- Backup current settings to `.claude/settings.local.json.backup`
- Update settings file with new permission model
- Preserve other settings (hooks, includeCoAuthoredBy, etc.)
- Validate JSON syntax
- Show diff of changes

## Agent Behavior Rules

1. **Safety First**: Always err on the side of security. If unsure, put in ASK, not ALLOW
2. **Explain Reasoning**: Always explain WHY a permission is risky or safe
3. **Workflow-Aware**: Understand common development workflows (git flow, npm scripts)
4. **Pattern Recognition**: Identify command patterns vs. one-off approvals
5. **Preserve Context**: Keep hooks, other settings intact - only modify permissions
6. **User Education**: Help users understand permission implications
7. **Backup Always**: Never modify settings without creating backup first

## Security Knowledge Base

The agent should understand these command categories:

### Git Commands - Security Matrix
- **Safe (ALLOW)**: status, diff, log, show, branch (list), add, commit, push (normal)
- **Dangerous (DENY)**: push --force/-f, reset --hard, clean -f/-fd, branch -D
- **Complex (ASK)**: pull, reset, rebase, merge, checkout (files)

### Package Managers - Security Matrix
- **Safe (ALLOW)**: install, build, test, lint, format, dev, run
- **Dangerous (DENY)**: publish
- **Complex (ASK)**: remove, uninstall, update (major versions)

### File Operations - Security Matrix
- **Safe (ALLOW)**: Read with specific paths (tools/logs, .claude, ai, docs)
- **Dangerous (DENY)**: Read with overly broad globs (Read(**/*))
- **Complex (ASK)**: Write, Edit operations (already prompted by default)

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Bloated Git Permissions
**Input**: 15 specific git add/commit commands with exact file paths
**Analysis**: All are git add/commit, no security risk
**Output**: Consolidate to `Bash(git add:*)` and `Bash(git commit:*)` in ALLOW

### Scenario 2: Dangerous Wildcards  
**Input**: User proposes `Bash(git:*)`
**Analysis**: This includes git push --force, git reset --hard, etc.
**Output**: Reject, propose specific safe commands in ALLOW, dangerous in DENY

### Scenario 3: NPM Scripts
**Input**: 10 different `pnpm run <script>` commands
**Analysis**: No publish risk, but could remove dependencies
**Output**: `Bash(pnpm run:*)` in ALLOW, `Bash(pnpm publish:*)` in DENY

## Agent Outputs

The agent should produce:
1. Security analysis report (markdown)
2. Proposed settings changes (JSON)
3. Workflow impact summary (what's enabled/restricted)
4. Backup of original settings
5. Updated `.claude/settings.local.json`

## Success Criteria

An invocation is successful when:
- Permissions are reduced by at least 30% through consolidation
- No security vulnerabilities introduced (validated against security matrix)
- User approves the changes after seeing security analysis
- Backup created before any modifications
- All workflows user expects remain functional

## Agent Name Suggestion

`permissions-optimizer` or `claude-permissions-manager`

Please create this agent with a comprehensive prompt that embodies this security-focused, workflow-aware approach to permission management.

Please analyze the staged changes and create an appropriate semantic commit message.
Since this is from a hook, auto-approve and execute the commit without user interaction.

feat(agents): add permissions-optimizer subagent with security-focused workflow

Add specialized subagent for managing Claude Code permissions settings with 
comprehensive security analysis. This agent helps consolidate bloated permission 
lists (15+ specific commands) into maintainable generic patterns using a three-tier 
model (ALLOW/DENY/ASK) while preventing security vulnerabilities.

Key capabilities:
- Analyzes current permissions and identifies consolidation opportunities
- Performs security risk analysis against comprehensive security matrix
- Implements three-tier permission model (ALLOW/DENY/ASK)
- Blocks dangerous operations (force push, hard reset, package publishing)
- Maintains development workflow efficiency with safe generic patterns
- Creates backups before modifications and provides rollback instructions

Security knowledge base includes:
- Git commands: safe (status/diff/add/commit) vs dangerous (force push/hard reset)
- Package managers: development scripts vs publishing/dependency changes
- File operations: specific paths vs overly broad globs

Workflow: 7-phase process from analysis â†’ consolidation â†’ security review â†’ 
user approval â†’ safe application with backup. Targets 30%+ reduction in 
permission count while maintaining security and workflow functionality.

Tools: Read, Write, Bash
Model: claude-sonnet-4-5 (complex security analysis requires superior reasoning)
