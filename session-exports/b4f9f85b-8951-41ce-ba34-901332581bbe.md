I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI for Claude, and I'm ready to assist you with codebase exploration and file operations.

I've reviewed the system context and understand:

- **Project Location**: `C:\Users\bruno\Documents\Work\Projects\fullstack-starter`
- **Current Branch**: `main` with pending changes (README.md, docs/prd files, and scope-analysis.md)
- **Platform**: Windows (Git Bash environment)
- **Today's Date**: 2025-10-19

I'm prepared to help you with:
- 🔍 **File Discovery** - Using Glob patterns and Grep for powerful searches
- 📖 **Code Analysis** - Reading and understanding file contents
- 🎯 **Pattern Matching** - Finding specific code patterns and structures
- 📋 **Codebase Exploration** - Systematic navigation through your project

**Key Tools I'll prioritize**:
1. Specialized Claude Code tools (Grep, Glob, Read, Write, Edit)
2. MCP tools when appropriate
3. Bash commands only for operations tools don't cover

**Guidance I'm Following**:
- Evidence-based reasoning over assumptions
- Parallel operations for efficiency
- Absolute file paths in responses
- No temporary file pollution
- Clear, professional communication

I'm ready to search, analyze, or explore your fullstack-starter project. What would you like me to help you find or analyze?
