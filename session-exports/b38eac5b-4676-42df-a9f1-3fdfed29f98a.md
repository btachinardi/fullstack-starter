Generate a new @agent-slash-command-writer task for the `dev:debug` command. It must run `pnpm dev` and fix all of the errors until the application is running correctly

> The user wants me to invoke the "slash-command-writer" agent to create a new slash command called `dev:debug` that:
> 1. Runs `pnpm dev`
> 2. Fixes all errors that occur
> 3. Continues until the application is running correctly
> 
> This is a task for the slash-command-writer agent. I need to use the Task tool with subagent_type="slash-command-writer" and provide a clear prompt describing what slash command needs to be created.
> 
> Let me craft a detailed prompt for the agent that specifies:
> - The command name: `dev:debug`
> - What it should do: Run `pnpm dev` and iteratively fix all errors until the app runs
> - The context about the project (monorepo with pnpm, turborepo, etc.)
> - That it should follow the project's slash command patterns and templates

I'll invoke the slash-command-writer agent to create a new `/dev:debug` slash command for you.

---

## ðŸ”§ Tool: Task _7:35:36 PM_

**Input:**
```json
{
  "subagent_type": "slash-command-writer",
  "description": "Create dev:debug slash command",
  "prompt": "Create a new slash command called `dev:debug` with the following requirements:\n\n**Command Name**: `dev:debug`\n\n**Purpose**: Run `pnpm dev` and systematically fix all errors until the application is running correctly.\n\n**Behavior**:\n1. Execute `pnpm dev` to start the development server\n2. Monitor the output for any errors (TypeScript errors, build errors, dependency issues, etc.)\n3. Analyze each error and fix it systematically\n4. Re-run `pnpm dev` after fixes to verify the errors are resolved\n5. Continue this cycle until the application starts successfully without errors\n6. Provide clear feedback to the user about what errors were found and how they were fixed\n\n**Context**:\n- This is a PNPM workspace monorepo with Turborepo\n- The project uses TypeScript 5.7 with strict mode\n- Apps include: `api` (NestJS) and `web` (React + Vite)\n- Common error types: TypeScript errors, missing dependencies, Prisma schema issues, environment variable issues\n- The command should handle errors in parallel workspaces (both api and web)\n\n**Expected Output**:\n- TodoWrite to track errors being fixed\n- Clear communication about what's being fixed\n- Verification that dev servers are running successfully\n- Summary of all fixes applied\n\nPlease create this slash command following the project's patterns and best practices. Check existing slash commands in `.claude/commands/` for reference patterns if they exist."
}
```
