Warmup

## ðŸ¤– Assistant _11:22:01 PM_

I'm ready to assist you with file searching and codebase exploration for the fullstack-starter project. I have access to powerful tools including:

- **Glob**: For broad file pattern matching across the codebase
- **Grep**: For searching file contents with regex patterns
- **Read**: For examining specific file contents
- **Bash**: For file operations and directory navigation

I can see the project is a Git repository on the main branch with recent work on specialized agents for code writing, documentation, and planning. The project appears to have agent configuration files organized by domain.

I'm ready to help you with any file search requests. What would you like me to find or explore in your codebase?

/git:commit

Subagent context (from SubagentStop hook):
- Agent: subagent-creator
- Session ID: 65618ff3-0cc3-47fa-92f2-b71a63447a1e
- Invocation ID: toolu_013WcHQYipuKJRcJnWV8D8Qj

Prompt:
Create a specialized subagent with the following specification:

**test-debugger**
- Name: test-debugger
- Purpose: Runs all project tests, identifies failures, and fixes them iteratively until all tests pass
- Capabilities:
  - Discovers and runs all test suites in the project
  - Analyzes test failure messages and stack traces
  - Identifies root causes of test failures
  - Fixes one failing test at a time systematically
  - Re-runs tests after each fix to verify and identify next failure
  - Continues iteration until all tests pass
  - Handles unit, integration, and e2e test failures
  - Preserves existing test coverage and functionality
- Tools needed: All tools (needs to read code/tests, edit files, run test commands)
- Workflow: Run tests â†’ Identify failure â†’ Fix root cause â†’ Re-run â†’ Repeat until all pass
- When to use: When tests are failing, after refactoring, or before releases
- Success criteria: All test suites pass with 100% success rate

Please create this subagent following project templates and best practices.

Please analyze the staged changes and create an appropriate semantic commit message.
Since this is from a hook, auto-approve and execute the commit without user interaction.

I'll analyze the staged changes and create an appropriate semantic commit message.

---

## ðŸ”§ Tool: Bash _11:22:02 PM_

**Command:** `git status`
**Description:** Check git status for staged changes

---

## âœ… Tool Result _11:22:06 PM_

```
On branch main
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 2 commits.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

---

## ðŸ”§ Tool: Bash _11:22:02 PM_

**Command:** `git diff --cached`
**Description:** View staged changes

```
a4c3a6d feat(agents): add specialized planning, research, and validation agents
bc9a35c feat(agents): add specialized code-writer, docs-writer, and prd-writer agents
8f83f32 config(commit-grouper): add autoCommit flag to agent metadata
945ccc2 refactor(git-commit): simplify workflow by removing interactive prompts
ef68ced refactor(agents): organize agent files by domain into subdirectories
```

I can see that there are no staged changes to commit - the working tree is clean. This appears to be a hook that was triggered after the subagent-creator agent completed its work, but the changes have already been committed or there were no changes to commit.

Let me verify if there are any unstaged changes that might need to be committed:

---

## ðŸ”§ Tool: Bash _11:22:12 PM_

**Command:** `git diff --name-only`
**Description:** Check for unstaged changes

---

## âœ… Tool Result _11:22:14 PM_

```

```

---

## ðŸ”§ Tool: Bash _11:22:12 PM_

**Command:** `git ls-files --others --exclude-standard`
**Description:** Check for untracked files

---

## âœ… Tool Result _11:22:15 PM_

```

```

---

## ðŸ¤– Assistant _11:22:20 PM_

There are no changes to commit. The working tree is completely clean with no staged changes, unstaged changes, or untracked files.

This is expected behavior - the subagent-creator agent likely completed its task without making any file changes, or any changes it made were already committed. The commit hook was triggered as part of the normal workflow, but since there's nothing to commit, no action is needed.

**Summary:** No commit created - working tree is clean with no changes to commit.
