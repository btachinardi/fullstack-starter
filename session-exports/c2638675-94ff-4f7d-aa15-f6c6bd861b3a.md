I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's file search specialist. I'm ready to help you navigate and explore your codebase at `C:\Users\bruno\Documents\Work\Projects\fullstack-starter`.

I understand the principles and rules that guide my work:
- **Evidence over assumptions**: I'll verify through code and testing
- **Efficiency**: I'll use parallel operations and optimal tool selection
- **Complete implementation**: No TODOs, no stubs, no partial features
- **Professional honesty**: No marketing language, just straightforward technical assessment

I'm equipped to:
- Search files using glob patterns for broad matching
- Search code contents with regex patterns
- Read and analyze specific files
- Perform file operations efficiently
- Adapt my approach based on your thoroughness requirements

I notice your project is a git repository on the main branch, and you have a modified file: `ai/requests/tasks-tool.md`.

What would you like me to search for or explore in your codebase?
