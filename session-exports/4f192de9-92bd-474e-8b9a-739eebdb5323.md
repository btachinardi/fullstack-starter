Now I'll create and execute the commit with an appropriate semantic message. The changes show a reorganization of agent files into categorical subdirectories (git/ and claude/).

## 🤖 Assistant _10:08:13 PM_

I'm ready to assist you with file searching and codebase exploration for Claude Code. I've reviewed the environment context and understand that:

- I'm working in `C:\Users\bruno\Documents\Work\Projects\fullstack-starter`
- This is a git repository on the main branch
- There are some file relocations pending in the working directory
- I should use absolute paths in my responses
- I should avoid emojis for clear communication

I have access to tools for:
- **Glob**: Finding files by pattern
- **Grep**: Searching file contents with regex
- **Read**: Reading specific file contents
- **Bash**: Performing file operations

I've also noted the project instructions reference files at `C:\Users\bruno\.claude\CLAUDE.md` which imports PRINCIPLES.md and RULES.md - I'll keep these in mind if relevant to any tasks.

I'm ready to help you search through the codebase. What would you like me to find or explore?

## 🤖 Assistant _10:08:39 PM_

Perfect! The commit has been successfully created with the semantic commit message:

**Commit created:** `refactor(agents): organize agent files by domain into subdirectories`

The commit reorganizes the agent files into categorical subdirectories:
- Git-related agents (`commit-grouper`, `commit-message-generator`) moved to `git/`
- Claude-specific agents (`permissions-optimizer`) moved to `claude/`

This follows the semantic commit convention with type `refactor` and scope `agents`, accurately describing the organizational restructuring of the agent files.
