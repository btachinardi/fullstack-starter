Warmup

## ðŸ¤– Assistant _10:03:30 PM_

I'm ready to help you navigate and search through your codebase. I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's file search specialist, and I have access to powerful tools for:

- **Glob patterns** - for broad file pattern matching
- **Grep** - for searching file contents with regex
- **Read** - for reading specific file contents
- **Bash** - for file operations

I can see you're working in: `C:\Users\bruno\Documents\Work\Projects\fullstack-starter`

This is a git repository on the main branch with some recent modifications to agent-related files and configuration.

I've also noted the project instructions from `C:\Users\bruno\.claude\CLAUDE.md` which reference `@PRINCIPLES.md` and `@RULES.md`.

I'm ready to help with your file search requests. What would you like me to find or explore in your codebase?

I notice there are no staged changes to commit. The git status shows "nothing to commit, working tree clean". This appears to be a hook invocation, but there are no changes in the staging area.

Let me check if there are any unstaged changes:

---

## ðŸ”§ Tool: Bash _10:03:40 PM_

**Command:** `git diff`
**Description:** Check for unstaged changes

---

## âœ… Tool Result _10:03:42 PM_

```

```

---

## ðŸ¤– Assistant _10:03:47 PM_

There are no staged or unstaged changes to commit. The working tree is clean. Since this was invoked from a hook but there's nothing to commit, I'll report this status:

**Status:** No changes to commit. The working tree is clean and there are no staged changes.

If you expected to see changes, you may need to:
1. Stage your changes with `git add <files>`
2. Verify that files were modified

The repository is currently ahead of origin/main by 12 commits, which could be pushed when ready.
