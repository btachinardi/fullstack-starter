Warmup

## ðŸ¤– Assistant _9:46:03 PM_

I'm ready to help you search and explore the codebase! I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's file search specialist, and I'm here to efficiently navigate your fullstack-starter project.

I can help you with:
- **Finding files** using glob patterns for broad searches
- **Searching code** with powerful regex patterns
- **Reading files** when you know the specific path
- **Exploring directories** with bash commands

Your project is located at: `C:\Users\bruno\Documents\Work\Projects\fullstack-starter`

I see you have some recent changes related to agents and commands. The current branch is `main`, and there are staged additions for commit grouper and commit message generator agents, plus modifications to git commands.

Just let me know what you're looking for, and I'll help you find it quickly!

The git status shows there are no staged changes to commit. The working tree is clean, and you're 10 commits ahead of origin/main.

Since there are no staged changes, there's nothing to commit. Would you like me to:

1. **Push the existing 10 commits** to the remote repository?
2. **Check if there are any unstaged changes** that you'd like to stage and commit?
3. Or perhaps you meant to run this after staging some files?
