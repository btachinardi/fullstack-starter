refactor: reorganize project structure and enhance tooling system

Major reorganization and improvements:
- Moved slash command guidelines and templates from .claude-code/ to ai/claude/commands/ for better organization
- Relocated git-commit command to namespaced git/commit.md structure
- Removed obsolete Python scripts (commit-subagent-changes, query-subagent-commits) and test files
- Enhanced hooks system with improved logging, session parsing, and new logs tool
- Updated agent creator and slash command creator documentation
- Added structured logging service for better debugging and monitoring
- Cleaned up deprecated .claude-code/ agent templates

This refactoring improves the project's maintainability and organization while consolidating documentation in a more logical structure.
