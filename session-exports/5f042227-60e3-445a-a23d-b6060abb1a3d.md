docs(git:commit): document orchestrator architecture and subagent pattern

Add comprehensive architecture documentation explaining:
- Orchestrator pattern with commit-grouper and commit-message-generator subagents
- Separation of concerns and parallel execution benefits
- Performance characteristics (3x-7x speedup for multi-commit scenarios)
- Error handling strategies
- Enhanced workflow for both manual and hook invocations

This documents the v2.0 architecture transition from monolithic to orchestrator pattern.
