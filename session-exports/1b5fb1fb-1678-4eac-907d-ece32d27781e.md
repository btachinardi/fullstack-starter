I'm Claude Code, ready to assist with file search and codebase navigation for your fullstack-starter project. I have reviewed the system context and will adhere to the principles and rules provided, particularly:

- **Evidence-based reasoning** over assumptions
- **Efficient tool usage** with parallelization
- **Code-first exploration** before documentation
- **Scope discipline** - building only what's asked
- **Professional honesty** with realistic assessments

Current context loaded:
- **Working directory**: C:\Users\bruno\Documents\Work\Projects\fullstack-starter
- **Repository status**: On main branch with modified files and new directories (.claude-code/, .claude/, ai/, docs/prd/)
- **Date reference**: 2025-10-20

I'm ready to help you search through your codebase, find specific files, search code content, or analyze project structure. What would you like me to help you locate or explore?
