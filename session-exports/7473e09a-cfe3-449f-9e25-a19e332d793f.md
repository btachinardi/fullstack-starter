/git:commit

Subagent context (from SubagentStop hook):
- Agent: slash-command-creator
- Session ID: 7956f499-969c-42eb-8e58-992809911a66
- Invocation ID: toolu_01Ein4UtsUSgNBxFjYJctooM

Prompt:
Update the existing `/git:commit` slash command to become a pure orchestrator that delegates to specialized subagents.

## Current State

The `/git:commit` command currently does everything:
- Analyzes git changes
- Groups files into logical commits
- Generates commit messages
- Executes commits
- Handles both manual invocation and SubagentStop hook

This is ~500+ lines and does too much.

## Target State

The command should become a lean orchestrator (~100-150 lines) that:
1. Delegates analysis/grouping to `commit-grouper` subagent
2. Delegates message generation to `commit-message-generator` subagent (in parallel for each group)
3. Executes the commits based on generated messages
4. Handles user interaction and error cases

## New Subagents Being Created

### commit-grouper
- **Input**: Git repository state (staged/unstaged files)
- **Output**: JSON structure with logical commit groups
- **Responsibility**: Analyze changes and cluster into groups
- **Invocation**: `Task(subagent_type="commit-grouper", prompt="Analyze git changes and create logical commit groups. Strategy: dependency-flow")`

### commit-message-generator
- **Input**: Single commit group (files + metadata)
- **Output**: Semantic commit message ready to execute
- **Responsibility**: Generate high-quality commit message
- **Invocation**: `Task(subagent_type="commit-message-generator", prompt="Generate semantic commit message for: <group-json>")`

## Updated Command Architecture

### Phase 1: Initial Analysis (Orchestrator)
```
1. Check git status
2. If no staged changes:
   - Ask user: stage all, stage specific, cancel
3. Verify there are changes to commit
```

### Phase 2: Delegate to commit-grouper (Subagent)
```
1. Invoke commit-grouper with git state
2. Receive commit groups JSON:
   {
     "groups": [
       { "id": "group-1", "type": "docs", "scope": "readme", "files": [...] },
       { "id": "group-2", "type": "feat", "scope": "tools", "files": [...] }
     ],
     "strategy": "dependency-flow",
     "total_files": 50,
     "total_groups": 7
   }
3. Present groups to user
4. Get user approval (approve, modify, cancel)
```

### Phase 3: Delegate to commit-message-generator (Parallel Subagents)
```
1. For each group, invoke commit-message-generator in PARALLEL:
   - Task 1: generate message for group-1
   - Task 2: generate message for group-2
   - Task 3: generate message for group-3
   - ... (all running concurrently)

2. Collect all generated messages:
   [
     { "group_id": "group-1", "message": "docs: rebrand...", "files": [...] },
     { "group_id": "group-2", "message": "feat(tools): add...", "files": [...] }
   ]

3. Present all messages to user for review
4. Get user approval
```

### Phase 4: Execute Commits (Orchestrator)
```
1. For each approved group (in dependency order):
   a. Stage specific files: git add <files>
   b. Commit with message: git commit -m "message"
   c. Verify commit created
   d. Show commit hash to user

2. Final verification:
   - Show all created commits
   - Confirm working directory is clean
```

## Orchestration Pattern

```markdown
## Objective

Intelligently commit git changes using semantic commit messages with smart grouping for multi-concern changes. This command orchestrates specialized subagents to analyze, group, and generate commit messages.

## Instructions

### Phase 1: Check Git State

Run these commands:
```bash
git status --porcelain
```

If no staged changes but unstaged exist:
- Ask user: stage all (`git add -A`), stage specific files, or cancel
- If cancel, exit

If no changes at all:
- Inform user and exit

### Phase 2: Analyze and Group Changes

Invoke the commit-grouper subagent:

```
Use Task tool with:
- subagent_type: "commit-grouper"  
- description: "Analyze git changes and create logical commit groups"
- prompt: "Analyze all staged git changes and group them into logical commits using the dependency-flow strategy. Return JSON structure with groups containing: id, type, scope, description, files, reasoning."
```

Wait for commit-grouper to return groups.

Parse the JSON response to extract commit groups.

Present groups to user:
```
Found X files across Y systems

Proposed Z commit groups:

Group 1 (type/scope): Description
  Files: file1, file2, ...
  Reason: ...

Group 2 (type/scope): Description
  Files: file3, file4, ...
  Reason: ...
```

Ask user:
- Approve groups? (Y/n)
- If no, offer to: modify groups, change strategy, cancel

### Phase 3: Generate Commit Messages (Parallel)

For each approved group, invoke commit-message-generator subagent IN PARALLEL.

IMPORTANT: Use a SINGLE message with MULTIPLE Task tool calls to run them concurrently.

Example for 3 groups:
```
In a single response, call Task tool three times:

Task 1:
- subagent_type: "commit-message-generator"
- description: "Generate message for group-1"
- prompt: "Generate semantic commit message for this group: <group-1-json>"

Task 2:
- subagent_type: "commit-message-generator"
- description: "Generate message for group-2"  
- prompt: "Generate semantic commit message for this group: <group-2-json>"

Task 3:
- subagent_type: "commit-message-generator"
- description: "Generate message for group-3"
- prompt: "Generate semantic commit message for this group: <group-3-json>"
```

Wait for all subagents to complete.

Collect all generated messages.

Present messages to user:
```
Generated commit messages:

Commit 1:
─────────────────────────────────────
<message-1>
─────────────────────────────────────
Files: <files-1>

Commit 2:
─────────────────────────────────────
<message-2>
─────────────────────────────────────
Files: <files-2>
```

Ask user to approve all messages (Y/n).

### Phase 4: Execute Commits

For each approved group (in dependency order from Phase 2):

1. Reset staging area: `git reset`
2. Stage files for this group: `git add <file1> <file2> ...`
3. Create commit: `git commit -m "<message>"`
4. Verify: `git log -1 --oneline`
5. Show commit hash to user

After all commits:
1. Show summary: `git log -<N> --oneline` (where N = number of commits)
2. Verify clean: `git status`
3. Inform user of success

### Phase 5: Error Handling

If commit fails:
- Show error to user
- Offer: retry, skip, abort remaining

If subagent fails:
- Show error
- Fall back to simpler strategy or manual commit

## SubagentStop Hook Integration (Optional)

When invoked from SubagentStop hook:
- Skip user prompts
- Auto-approve single commit strategy
- Include agent metadata in commit message footer
- Execute immediately

## Success Criteria

- Multiple logical commits created from complex changes
- Each commit has focused scope and clear message
- Commits follow semantic convention
- Working directory is clean
- User informed of all actions

## Performance

- Phase 3 runs in parallel (N message generators run simultaneously)
- Total time ≈ max(grouping time, longest message generation time) + commit execution time
- Much faster than sequential message generation

## Command Version

2.0 - Orchestrator pattern with specialized subagents
```

## Key Improvements

1. **Separation of Concerns**:
   - Grouping logic → commit-grouper subagent
   - Message generation → commit-message-generator subagent
   - Orchestration → /git:commit command

2. **Parallel Execution**:
   - All message generators run simultaneously
   - 3x-7x faster for multi-commit scenarios

3. **Maintainability**:
   - Each component is testable independently
   - Easier to improve grouping or message generation separately
   - Command is now simple orchestration logic

4. **Reusability**:
   - commit-grouper can be used by other commands
   - commit-message-generator can be invoked directly
   - Components are composable

## Migration Notes

Keep the original command behavior:
- Still handles manual invocation
- Still works with SubagentStop hook
- Still supports all original features
- Just uses subagents internally

Update the command at: `.claude/commands/git/commit.md`

Create this updated orchestrator command that delegates to specialized subagents while maintaining all existing functionality.

Please analyze the staged changes and create an appropriate semantic commit message.
Since this is from a hook, auto-approve and execute the commit without user interaction.
