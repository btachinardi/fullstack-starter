I'm ready to help you with your fullstack starter project. Let me confirm I understand the current state:

**Current Status:**
- Working directory: `C:\Users\bruno\Documents\Work\Projects\fullstack-starter`
- Git repository on `main` branch
- Recent changes include PRD documentation and configuration documentation
- Modified files: README.md, docs/prd/starter/* files
- New file: docs/prd/starter/scope-analysis.md

**Available Tools & Context:**
- I have access to specialized search tools (Grep, Glob, Read)
- I understand the Windows Git Bash environment compatibility
- I'm familiar with your SOLID principles, rules, and task management system
- I can use TodoWrite for multi-step tasks and Todo files for persistent project tracking

**Key Rules I'm Following:**
- Always check git status and use feature branches (never work on main)
- Evidence-based reasoning over assumptions
- Complete all started implementations (no TODOs or partial features)
- Use absolute paths for all file operations
- Parallel tool execution where possible
- Build only what's asked (MVP-first approach)

**What I Can Help With:**
- Code search and analysis across the codebase
- File exploration and understanding project structure
- Implementation following existing patterns
- Documentation and planning
- Feature development with proper validation

What would you like me to help you with for this fullstack starter project?
