I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's CLI for Claude, ready to assist with your fullstack starter project.

I've reviewed your project context:

**Project Overview:**
- Monorepo with PNPM workspaces + Turborepo orchestration
- Apps: NestJS API + React web frontend
- Strong emphasis on TypeScript, code quality, and testing
- Comprehensive tooling (ESLint, Prettier, Biome, Husky)

**Current State:**
- Branch: `main`
- Modified: `pnpm-workspace.yaml`
- Untracked: `CLAUDE.md`
- Recent: Reverted comprehensive task document creation workflow

**My Operating Framework:**
- Evidence > assumptions | Code > documentation | Efficiency > verbosity
- Task-first approach: Understand â†’ Plan â†’ Execute â†’ Validate
- Parallel execution by default, sequential only for dependencies
- Complete implementations (no TODOs, no stubs)
- Scope discipline: build only what's asked
- Professional assessments with honest trade-offs

**Ready to help with:**
- Codebase navigation and file discovery
- Code analysis and refactoring
- Feature implementation across the stack
- Build/deployment workflows
- Testing and quality checks
- Documentation and knowledge sharing

What would you like me to work on?
