## 🤖 Assistant _9:13:22 PM_

I can see you have:
- **Modified files** (5 documentation files)
- **Untracked files** (new directories: `.claude/`, `ai/`, `docs/prd/PRD_INDEX_TEMPLATE.md`, `docs/prd/PRD_TEMPLATE.md`, `docs/prd/agents/`, `tools/`)

Since there are no staged changes, I need to ask you which changes you'd like to commit:

**Option 1: Stage all changes**
- This would include all modified documentation files AND all new untracked files
- Command: `git add -A`

**Option 2: Stage only modified documentation files**
- This would commit just the PRD updates, leaving new directories for separate commits
- Command: `git add README.md docs/prd/starter/*.md`

**Option 3: Stage specific groups**
- Stage by logical grouping (e.g., docs separately from tooling/claude config)

Which approach would you prefer? Or would you like me to analyze the untracked files first to better understand what's being added?

---

## 👤 User _9:14:24 PM_

Analyze an generate commits by yourself, it should be multiple logical groupings

---

## 🧠 Assistant (thinking) _9:14:29 PM_

> The user wants me to analyze the changes and create multiple logical commits automatically. Let me follow the /git:commit command workflow:
> 
> 1. First, I need to understand what all the changes are
> 2. Analyze both modified and untracked files
> 3. Group them logically
> 4. Generate appropriate commit messages
> 5. Execute the commits
> 
> Let me start by examining what's in each of the untracked directories and the nature of the modified files.

## 🤖 Assistant _9:17:03 PM_

Based on the git status, I can see the following logical groupings:

**Modified files:**
- README.md (rebranding)
- docs/prd/starter/*.md (PRD portfolio updates)

**Untracked new additions:**
- `.claude/` (Claude Code config: agents, commands, settings)
- `ai/` (Claude Code documentation and guidelines)
- `docs/prd/PRD_*.md` (PRD templates)
- `docs/prd/agents/` (Agent PRD)
- `tools/` (Tools package)

I'll create 6 logical commits:

1. **Rebranding** (README only)
2. **PRD portfolio reorganization** (all PRD updates)
3. **PRD templates** (template files + agent PRD)
4. **Tools package** (new tools/ directory)
5. **Claude Code configuration** (.claude/ directory)
6. **Claude Code documentation** (ai/ directory)

Let me execute these commits:

✓ Done! I've updated the Claude Code settings to use generic permission patterns.

**Changes made:**

**Before:** 27 specific command approvals
**After:** 8 generic patterns covering all development workflows

The new generic patterns provide:
- **Better coverage:** Automatically allows new variations without manual approval
- **Less maintenance:** No need to update settings for similar commands
- **Cleaner config:** Reduced from 27 lines to 8 lines

**Final commit summary:**

---

## 🤖 Assistant _9:24:24 PM_

You're absolutely right! I was too aggressive with those wildcards. Let me reconsider the security implications:

**Security risks I introduced:**

1. **`Bash(git:*)`** - Allows destructive operations like:
   - `git push --force` (overwrites remote history)
   - `git reset --hard` (loses local changes)
   - `git clean -fd` (deletes untracked files)
   - `git branch -D` (force delete branches)

2. **`Bash(pnpm:*)`** - Allows dangerous operations like:
   - `pnpm publish` (publishes to npm registry)
   - `pnpm uninstall` (removes dependencies)
   - `pnpm remove` (similar)

3. **`Bash(npm:*)`** - Same issues as pnpm

4. **`Bash(node tools/dist:*)`** - Depends on what scripts we have, but could execute arbitrary code

Let me revert this and create a more balanced approach:

## 🤖 Assistant _9:25:20 PM_

Much better! Here's the security-conscious permission model I've implemented:

**✓ ALLOW (Safe operations - no prompts):**
- Custom tools scripts: `node tools/dist:*`, `pnpm tools:*`
- Development commands: `pnpm install/build/test/typecheck/lint/format/dev`
- Git read operations: `status`, `diff`, `log`, `show`, `branch`
- Git safe writes: `add`, `commit`
- Reading logs and documentation

**✗ DENY (Explicitly blocked - always rejected):**
- `git push --force` (overwrites remote history)
- `git reset --hard` (loses local changes permanently)
- `git clean -f` (deletes untracked files)
- `pnpm/npm publish` (could publish to npm registry)

**? ASK (Requires confirmation):**
- `git push/pull` (affects remote repository)
- `git checkout/reset/rebase/merge` (can change history)
- `pnpm/npm remove/uninstall` (modifies dependencies)

This provides:
1. **Security**: Blocks destructive operations, prompts for risky ones
2. **Convenience**: Auto-approves safe development workflow
3. **Control**: You get asked before anything touches remote or deletes things

Should I commit this safer configuration?

This is a lot better! But we should be a little bit more permissive for regular agent workflow git actions, for example, creating a new branch, switching branches, creating pull requests

---

## 🧠 Assistant (thinking) _9:26:12 PM_

> The user is right - the current setup is too restrictive for normal development workflow. Let me think about what operations should be allowed for regular agent workflows:

> **Safe git operations that should be allowed:**
> - `git branch <name>` - creating branches (safe)
> - `git checkout -b <name>` - creating and switching to new branch (safe)
> - `git checkout <branch>` - switching branches (generally safe if working tree is clean)
> - `git push` - pushing to remote (standard workflow, not destructive unless --force)
> - `gh pr create` - creating pull requests (safe, standard workflow)
> - `gh pr view` - viewing PRs (read-only)
> - `gh pr list` - listing PRs (read-only)
> 
> **Operations that should still require confirmation:**
> - `git reset` - can lose uncommitted work
> - `git rebase` - rewrites history
> - `git merge` - can have conflicts
> - `git pull` - can have conflicts/overwrites
> 
> **Operations that should be denied:**
> - `git push --force` - destructive
> - `git reset --hard` - destructive
> - `git clean -f` - destructive
> - Publishing to npm

Perfect! Now the permissions are workflow-friendly while still being secure:

**✓ ALLOW (Standard development workflow):**
- Development tools & scripts
- Package manager operations (install, build, test, lint, format)
- Git workflow: status, diff, log, branch, checkout, add, commit, **push**
- GitHub CLI: **pr create/view/list**, **issue management**
- Reading logs and documentation

**✗ DENY (Destructive operations - always blocked):**
- `git push --force` / `-f` (overwrites remote history)
- `git reset --hard` (permanent data loss)
- `git clean -f/-fd` (deletes files/directories)
- `git branch -D` (force delete branches)
- Publishing to npm

**? ASK (Potentially complex - confirmation required):**
- `git pull` (can cause merge conflicts)
- `git reset` (can lose uncommitted work)
- `git rebase/merge` (rewrites history or causes conflicts)
- Removing dependencies

This allows agents to:
1. ✓ Create branches
2. ✓ Switch branches  
3. ✓ Commit and push changes
4. ✓ Create pull requests
5. ✓ Manage GitHub issues

While protecting you from accidental:
- Force pushes
- Data loss
- Irreversible deletions

Let me commit this balanced configuration:

refactor(config): balance permissions for workflow and security

Configure three-tier permission model:

ALLOW (no prompts):
- Development: pnpm/npm install, build, test, lint, format
- Git workflow: status, diff, log, branch, checkout, add, commit, push
- GitHub CLI: pr and issue management
- Tools: custom scripts and log reading

DENY (always blocked):
- git push --force/-f (overwrites remote history)
- git reset --hard (permanent data loss)
- git clean -f/-fd (deletes files)
- git branch -D (force delete)
- npm/pnpm publish (accidental publishing)

ASK (requires confirmation):
- git pull/reset/rebase/merge (complex operations)
- npm/pnpm remove/uninstall (dependency changes)

This enables standard agent workflows (branching, committing, PRs)
while preventing destructive operations and prompting for risky ones.

## 🤖 Assistant _9:27:05 PM_

✓ Perfect! I've amended the commit with a much better security model. 

**Key improvements:**

1. **Workflow-friendly**: Agents can now freely create branches, commit, push, and create PRs without prompts
2. **Security-conscious**: Explicitly blocks destructive operations that could lose data or break remote history
3. **Balanced confirmation**: Only asks about operations that are genuinely complex (pull, rebase, merge)

The three-tier model (ALLOW/DENY/ASK) gives you the best of both worlds - efficient automated workflows with safety guardrails.

Your branch is now 8 commits ahead of origin/main, ready to push when you're ready!

## 👤 User _9:29:23 PM_

Create a specialized subagent for managing Claude Code permissions settings with a security-focused workflow.

## Agent Purpose

Create an agent that consolidates specific command permissions into generic patterns while maintaining security through a multi-step analysis workflow. This agent should help users clean up bloated permission lists (like we had with 27+ specific commands) into maintainable generic patterns, but with proper security review steps.

## What We Just Learned

We went through a process where:
1. Started with 27 specific approved commands in `.claude/settings.local.json`
2. First attempt: consolidated too aggressively to wildcards like `Bash(git:*)`, `Bash(pnpm:*)` - **SECURITY RISK**
3. User correctly identified security issues (force push, hard reset, publish commands, etc.)
4. Final solution: Implemented three-tier permission model (ALLOW/DENY/ASK) with balanced security

## Agent Workflow

The agent should follow these steps:

### Step 1: Analyze Current Permissions
- Read `.claude/settings.local.json`
- Parse existing `allow`, `deny`, and `ask` arrays
- Identify patterns and redundancy in current permissions
- Count total permissions and flag if > 15 as potentially bloated

### Step 2: Identify Consolidation Opportunities
Group similar commands that could be consolidated:
- Multiple git commands with different args → `git <command>:*` patterns
- Multiple pnpm/npm scripts → `pnpm <script>:*` patterns
- Multiple tool invocations → `node <path>:*` patterns
- File read patterns → glob patterns like `Read(**/path/**)`

### Step 3: Security Risk Analysis (CRITICAL)
For each proposed generic pattern, analyze security implications:

**High Risk (should be DENY or ASK):**
- `git push --force`, `git push -f` → Remote history destruction
- `git reset --hard` → Permanent local data loss
- `git clean -f/-fd` → Deletes untracked files
- `git branch -D` → Force delete branches
- `npm publish`, `pnpm publish` → Accidental publishing
- `git rebase`, `git merge` → Complex, can cause conflicts
- Package removal commands → Dependency changes

**Medium Risk (should be ASK):**
- `git pull` → Can cause merge conflicts
- `git reset` (without --hard) → Can lose work
- `git checkout` to files → Discards changes
- Dependency modifications

**Low Risk (can be ALLOW):**
- Read-only git: status, diff, log, show, branch
- Safe git workflow: add, commit, checkout branches, push (non-force)
- Build commands: install, build, test, lint, format
- GitHub CLI: pr, issue commands
- File reading with appropriate paths

### Step 4: Propose Three-Tier Model
Generate recommendations in this format:

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "// Development workflow - safe operations",
      "Bash(pnpm install:*)",
      "Bash(pnpm build:*)",
      "// Git read operations",
      "Bash(git status:*)",
      "// Git safe workflow", 
      "Bash(git add:*)",
      "Bash(git commit:*)",
      "Bash(git push:*)",
      "// GitHub CLI",
      "Bash(gh pr:*)"
    ],
    "deny": [
      "// Destructive git operations",
      "Bash(git push --force:*)",
      "Bash(git push -f:*)",
      "Bash(git reset --hard:*)",
      "// Publishing",
      "Bash(npm publish:*)"
    ],
    "ask": [
      "// Complex git operations",
      "Bash(git pull:*)",
      "Bash(git rebase:*)",
      "// Dependency changes",
      "Bash(pnpm remove:*)"
    ]
  }
}
```

### Step 5: Present Security Analysis
Show user:
- **Current state**: X permissions, Y are redundant
- **Proposed consolidation**: Reduced to Z generic patterns
- **Security breakdown**:
  - ✓ ALLOW: List safe operations (with brief reason)
  - ✗ DENY: List blocked operations (with risk explanation)
  - ? ASK: List prompted operations (with complexity note)
- **Workflow impact**: What workflows this enables vs. restricts

### Step 6: Get User Approval
Present the analysis and ask user to:
- Approve and apply changes
- Modify specific permissions (more/less restrictive)
- Cancel if they want to keep current setup

### Step 7: Apply Changes
- Backup current settings to `.claude/settings.local.json.backup`
- Update settings file with new permission model
- Preserve other settings (hooks, includeCoAuthoredBy, etc.)
- Validate JSON syntax
- Show diff of changes

## Agent Behavior Rules

1. **Safety First**: Always err on the side of security. If unsure, put in ASK, not ALLOW
2. **Explain Reasoning**: Always explain WHY a permission is risky or safe
3. **Workflow-Aware**: Understand common development workflows (git flow, npm scripts)
4. **Pattern Recognition**: Identify command patterns vs. one-off approvals
5. **Preserve Context**: Keep hooks, other settings intact - only modify permissions
6. **User Education**: Help users understand permission implications
7. **Backup Always**: Never modify settings without creating backup first

## Security Knowledge Base

The agent should understand these command categories:

### Git Commands - Security Matrix
- **Safe (ALLOW)**: status, diff, log, show, branch (list), add, commit, push (normal)
- **Dangerous (DENY)**: push --force/-f, reset --hard, clean -f/-fd, branch -D
- **Complex (ASK)**: pull, reset, rebase, merge, checkout (files)

### Package Managers - Security Matrix
- **Safe (ALLOW)**: install, build, test, lint, format, dev, run
- **Dangerous (DENY)**: publish
- **Complex (ASK)**: remove, uninstall, update (major versions)

### File Operations - Security Matrix
- **Safe (ALLOW)**: Read with specific paths (tools/logs, .claude, ai, docs)
- **Dangerous (DENY)**: Read with overly broad globs (Read(**/*))
- **Complex (ASK)**: Write, Edit operations (already prompted by default)

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Bloated Git Permissions
**Input**: 15 specific git add/commit commands with exact file paths
**Analysis**: All are git add/commit, no security risk
**Output**: Consolidate to `Bash(git add:*)` and `Bash(git commit:*)` in ALLOW

### Scenario 2: Dangerous Wildcards  
**Input**: User proposes `Bash(git:*)`
**Analysis**: This includes git push --force, git reset --hard, etc.
**Output**: Reject, propose specific safe commands in ALLOW, dangerous in DENY

### Scenario 3: NPM Scripts
**Input**: 10 different `pnpm run <script>` commands
**Analysis**: No publish risk, but could remove dependencies
**Output**: `Bash(pnpm run:*)` in ALLOW, `Bash(pnpm publish:*)` in DENY

## Agent Outputs

The agent should produce:
1. Security analysis report (markdown)
2. Proposed settings changes (JSON)
3. Workflow impact summary (what's enabled/restricted)
4. Backup of original settings
5. Updated `.claude/settings.local.json`

## Success Criteria

An invocation is successful when:
- Permissions are reduced by at least 30% through consolidation
- No security vulnerabilities introduced (validated against security matrix)
- User approves the changes after seeing security analysis
- Backup created before any modifications
- All workflows user expects remain functional

## Agent Name Suggestion

`permissions-optimizer` or `claude-permissions-manager`

Please create this agent with a comprehensive prompt that embodies this security-focused, workflow-aware approach to permission management.

# Permissions Optimizer Agent Created Successfully

## Summary

Created a comprehensive security-focused sub-agent for managing Claude Code permissions. This agent consolidates bloated permission lists (like your 27-command example) into maintainable generic patterns using a three-tier security model (ALLOW/DENY/ASK).

## Agent Capabilities

### Core Features
- **Security-First Analysis:** Multi-phase workflow that analyzes every permission pattern for security risks
- **Three-Tier Model:** Implements ALLOW (safe), DENY (dangerous), ASK (complex) permission structure
- **Pattern Consolidation:** Reduces redundant specific permissions into efficient generic patterns
- **Knowledge Base:** Embedded security matrix for git, package managers, file operations, and GitHub CLI
- **Workflow Protection:** Maintains development efficiency while preventing dangerous operations
- **Safe Application:** Always creates backup before modifying settings

### Security Intelligence
The agent understands:
- **High Risk (DENY):** Force push, hard reset, clean, publishing
- **Medium Risk (ASK):** Pull, rebase, merge, dependency changes
- **Low Risk (ALLOW):** Status, diff, add, commit, build commands

### Seven-Phase Workflow
1. **Analyze:** Parse current permissions and identify redundancy
2. **Consolidate:** Group similar commands into generic patterns
3. **Security Analysis:** Classify every pattern by risk level
4. **Propose Model:** Generate three-tier permission structure
5. **Present:** Show security analysis with clear explanations
6. **Approve:** Get explicit user consent before changes
7. **Apply:** Safely update settings with backup

## File Location

**Agent File:** `C:\Users\bruno\Documents\Work\Projects\fullstack-starter\.claude\agents\permissions-optimizer.md`

**Tools:** Read, Write, Bash

**Model:** claude-sonnet-4-5 (complex security analysis requires superior reasoning)

## Invocation

To use this agent:

**Basic Invocation:**
```
Task: subagent_type="permissions-optimizer", prompt="Analyze my Claude Code permissions and propose a consolidated security model"
```

**Specific Invocation:**
```
Task: subagent_type="permissions-optimizer", prompt="I have 27 approved commands in .claude/settings.local.json. Consolidate them using the three-tier permission model while ensuring git force push and publish commands are blocked."
```

**Wildcard Safety Check:**
```
Task: subagent_type="permissions-optimizer", prompt="I want to approve Bash(git:*) to avoid prompts. Analyze security implications and propose a safer alternative."
```

## Example Scenarios Handled

### Scenario 1: Bloated Permission List
- **Input:** 27 specific git/pnpm commands
- **Output:** ~8-10 generic patterns with 60%+ reduction
- **Security:** Dangerous ops moved to DENY, complex to ASK

### Scenario 2: Unsafe Wildcard Proposal
- **Input:** User wants `Bash(git:*)`
- **Output:** Rejects unsafe pattern, proposes split: safe in ALLOW, dangerous in DENY, complex in ASK
- **Security:** Prevents force push, hard reset, clean accidents

### Scenario 3: NPM Scripts Consolidation
- **Input:** 10 specific `pnpm run <script>` approvals
- **Output:** Single `Bash(pnpm run:*)` in ALLOW, `pnpm publish` in DENY
- **Security:** Scripts run freely, publishing blocked

## Key Features

1. **Security Matrix:** Comprehensive knowledge base of command risks
2. **Risk Explanations:** Every DENY entry includes clear risk reasoning
3. **Workflow Awareness:** Understands common development patterns
4. **User Control:** Requires explicit approval before any changes
5. **Backup Safety:** Always creates timestamped backup first
6. **Rollback Ready:** Provides clear rollback instructions
7. **JSON Validation:** Ensures settings file remains valid
8. **Context Preservation:** Maintains hooks, includeCoAuthoredBy, etc.

## Next Steps

### Test the Agent

Try these invocations to test:

1. **Analysis Run (No Changes):**
   ```
   Task: subagent_type="permissions-optimizer", prompt="Analyze my current permissions in .claude/settings.local.json and show me consolidation opportunities. Don't make changes yet, just show me what you recommend."
   ```

2. **Full Optimization:**
   ```
   Task: subagent_type="permissions-optimizer", prompt="Optimize my Claude Code permissions. I have too many specific approvals and want to consolidate them into generic patterns using the three-tier security model."
   ```

3. **Security Review:**
   ```
   Task: subagent_type="permissions-optimizer", prompt="Review my current permissions for security issues. Flag any dangerous patterns and recommend improvements."
   ```

### Integration Opportunities

- **With slash-command-creator:** Create custom commands that work with optimized permissions
- **With analysis-plan-executor:** Implement permission strategies from analysis docs
- **Standalone:** Use anytime permission list becomes bloated or needs security review

### Refinement

Based on real usage, you may want to:
1. Add more commands to the security matrix (language-specific tools, etc.)
2. Customize risk levels based on your team's workflow
3. Add project-specific dangerous patterns
4. Create preset permission templates for different project types

## 👤 User _9:37:01 PM_

Then, I want you to also learn from the complete `/git:commit` experience. Can we break this command down into small tasks that we can delegate to subagents? For example, we could have a subagent for logical commit grouping/clustering, and another one that can be fed per group/cluster information and generate the commits from this info.


Then, the /git:commit command should be changed to only contain orchestration instructions, for example, to start by grouping and clustering logical commits, and then delegating multiple tasks to the commit creator subagent, one task per generated cluster/group, but that could all run in parallel.

Use the specialized @agent-subagent-creator and @agent-slash-command-creator agents to perform these agent creations and command edit

## 🧠 Assistant (thinking) _9:37:18 PM_

> The user wants to refactor the `/git:commit` command by breaking it down into specialized subagents. This is a great idea for separation of concerns. Let me think about the architecture:

>    - **Subagent 2**: `commit-message-generator` - Takes a group of files and generates semantic commit message

> 
> Let me invoke the agents:
> 1. First, use subagent-creator to create both subagents (commit-grouper and commit-message-generator)
> 2. Then, use slash-command-creator to update the /git:commit command to be an orchestrator

> Wait, I need to think about this more carefully. The slash-command-creator needs to reference the subagents that are being created. So it might be better to:

> But actually, I can provide the full context to slash-command-creator about what the subagents will do, and it can reference them.

## 🤖 Assistant _9:37:18 PM_

Excellent idea! Let's decompose the `/git:commit` command into specialized subagents with a clear orchestration pattern. I'll create:

1. **commit-grouper**: Analyzes git changes and clusters them into logical commit groups
2. **commit-message-generator**: Takes a group and generates a semantic commit message
3. **Updated /git:commit**: Pure orchestration - delegates to subagents, enables parallel execution

Let me invoke the agents in parallel:

**Input:**
```json
{
  "subagent_type": "subagent-creator",
  "description": "Create commit-grouper subagent",
  "prompt": "Create a specialized subagent for analyzing git changes and creating logical commit groups.\n\n## Agent Purpose\n\nThis agent analyzes git changes (both staged and unstaged) and clusters them into logical groups that should be committed together. It's the first phase of an intelligent multi-commit workflow.\n\n## Context from `/git:commit` Command\n\nThe current `/git:commit` command does everything in one place. We're decomposing it into:\n1. **commit-grouper** (THIS AGENT) - Analyzes and groups changes\n2. **commit-message-generator** (separate agent) - Generates messages per group\n3. **Updated /git:commit command** - Orchestrates the workflow\n\n## Agent Responsibilities\n\n### Input\nThe agent receives:\n- Current git repository state (staged and unstaged changes)\n- Optional user preferences for grouping strategy\n\n### Output\nA structured list of commit groups with:\n```json\n{\n  \"groups\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"group-1\",\n      \"type\": \"docs\",\n      \"scope\": \"readme\", \n      \"description\": \"Documentation rebranding\",\n      \"files\": [\"README.md\"],\n      \"reasoning\": \"Single file, documentation change, isolated from other changes\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"group-2\",\n      \"type\": \"feat\",\n      \"scope\": \"tools\",\n      \"description\": \"Add CLI tools package\",\n      \"files\": [\"tools/**\"],\n      \"reasoning\": \"New package addition, complete feature, independent from other changes\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"strategy\": \"dependency-flow\",\n  \"total_files\": 50,\n  \"total_groups\": 7\n}\n```\n\n## Workflow Steps\n\n### Step 1: Analyze Git State\n- Run `git status --porcelain` to see all changes\n- If no staged changes, ask user:\n  - Stage all (`git add -A`)\n  - Stage specific files (provide selection)\n  - Cancel operation\n- Identify: modified, added, deleted, renamed files\n- Get file diffs for context\n\n### Step 2: Categorize Files\nAnalyze each file to determine:\n\n**By System/Scope:**\n- Frontend: `apps/web/`, `packages/ui/`, React components\n- Backend: `apps/api/`, server code, database\n- Configuration: config files, `.env`, `package.json`, tooling\n- Documentation: `docs/`, `README.md`, `.md` files\n- Tests: `*.test.*`, `*.spec.*`, test directories\n- Infrastructure: CI/CD, Docker, deployment\n- Shared/Platform: `packages/` affecting multiple apps\n- Tools: `tools/`, scripts, utilities\n- Claude Config: `.claude/`, `ai/` directories\n\n**By Change Nature:**\n- New feature (new files, new functionality)\n- Bug fix (fixing broken behavior)\n- Refactoring (improving code structure)\n- Maintenance (dependencies, config, tooling)\n- Documentation (only docs changes)\n- Testing (only test changes)\n\n### Step 3: Apply Grouping Strategy\n\n**Strategy 1: Single-Concern (Default)**\nPrinciple: Each commit should have one clear purpose\n\nRules:\n- Group by system + change type (e.g., \"frontend feature\", \"backend fix\")\n- Keep tightly coupled changes together\n- Separate independent changes\n- Maximum 10 files per group (split if larger)\n\n**Strategy 2: Dependency-Flow**\nPrinciple: Commit in order of dependencies\n\nRules:\n- Config/setup changes first\n- Shared packages before apps\n- Backend before frontend (if API contract changes)\n- Documentation last\n- Within each layer, apply single-concern grouping\n\n**Strategy 3: File-Type**\nPrinciple: Group by file type/location\n\nRules:\n- All documentation together\n- All config together\n- All source code together\n- Useful for simple updates across many files\n\n### Step 4: Generate Groups\n\nFor each group, determine:\n\n**Commit Type:** (following semantic commit convention)\n- `feat` - New features or functionality\n- `fix` - Bug fixes\n- `docs` - Documentation only\n- `refactor` - Code restructuring\n- `test` - Test additions/updates\n- `chore` - Maintenance (deps, config, tooling)\n- `style` - Code style/formatting\n- `perf` - Performance improvements\n- `ci` - CI/CD changes\n- `build` - Build system changes\n\n**Scope:** (what area is affected)\n- `api`, `web`, `ui`, `db`, `config`, `docs`, `ci`, `tools`, `agents`, `commands`, etc.\n- Omit if change is truly global\n\n**Files:** List of files in this group\n\n**Reasoning:** Brief explanation of why these files are grouped together\n\n### Step 5: Validate Groups\n\nCheck quality:\n- ✓ Each group has clear single purpose\n- ✓ No overlap between groups (each file in exactly one group)\n- ✓ Groups are independently committable\n- ✓ Dependency order is respected\n- ✓ Size is reasonable (not too large, not overly granular)\n\n### Step 6: Present to User\n\nShow the grouping plan:\n```\nFound 50 changed files across 3 systems\n\nProposed 7 commit groups:\n\nGroup 1 (docs): Documentation rebranding\n  Type: docs, Scope: readme\n  Files: README.md\n  Reason: Single file, documentation change\n\nGroup 2 (feat/tools): Add CLI tools package  \n  Type: feat, Scope: tools\n  Files: tools/** (20 files)\n  Reason: New package, complete feature\n\nGroup 3 (feat/config): Add Claude Code agents\n  Type: feat, Scope: agents\n  Files: .claude/agents/** (7 files)\n  Reason: Related agent configurations\n\n[... etc ...]\n\nStrategy: dependency-flow\nTotal: 7 groups from 50 files\n```\n\nAsk user to:\n- Approve groups\n- Modify groups (merge, split, reorder)\n- Change strategy and regroup\n- Cancel operation\n\n## Grouping Intelligence\n\n### When to Keep Together\n- Files modified for the same feature\n- Tightly coupled code (e.g., component + test + story)\n- Config + code that depends on it\n- Related documentation updates\n\n### When to Split Apart\n- Different systems (frontend vs backend)\n- Different change types (feature vs fix vs docs)\n- Independent features that can work alone\n- Unrelated file changes (happened to be modified together)\n\n### Special Cases\n\n**Large Refactoring:**\nIf 100+ files changed for refactoring:\n- Group by module/package\n- Keep related changes together\n- Don't create 100 tiny commits\n\n**Dependency Updates:**\n- All package.json changes in one commit\n- Lock file changes with package.json\n- Type: `chore`, Scope: `deps`\n\n**Documentation:**\n- Group related docs together\n- Separate from code changes\n- Keep templates separate from content\n\n**Configuration:**\n- Group by config type (eslint, prettier, tsconfig, etc.)\n- Keep tool-specific configs together\n- Separate from feature code\n\n## Edge Cases\n\n### All Files in One System\nIf all changes are in `apps/web/`:\n- Still group by change type (feature, fix, refactor)\n- Consider file count and logical boundaries\n\n### Single File with Multiple Concerns\nIf one file has both feature + fix:\n- Generally keep together (can't split a file)\n- Note in reasoning that it's mixed concerns\n- Suggest refactoring in future\n\n### New Directory Structure\nIf adding new directories:\n- Group entire directory together\n- Include related docs/tests with directory\n- One commit per major directory addition\n\n## Output Format\n\nReturn JSON structure that can be parsed programmatically:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"groups\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"group-1\",\n      \"type\": \"docs|feat|fix|chore|refactor|test|style|perf|ci|build\",\n      \"scope\": \"area-affected\",\n      \"description\": \"Brief description\",\n      \"files\": [\"path/to/file1\", \"path/to/file2\"],\n      \"reasoning\": \"Why these files are grouped\",\n      \"size\": \"small|medium|large\",\n      \"dependencies\": [\"group-2\"]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"strategy\": \"single-concern|dependency-flow|file-type\",\n  \"total_files\": 50,\n  \"total_groups\": 7,\n  \"recommendations\": [\n    \"Consider splitting group-3 if features are independent\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n- All changed files accounted for in exactly one group\n- Groups are logical and independently committable\n- Dependency order is correct (if using dependency-flow)\n- No group is too large (>20 files suggests splitting)\n- No over-granularity (don't split what belongs together)\n- User approves the grouping plan\n\n## Example from Recent Work\n\nFrom the session where we created 7 commits:\n```\nInput: 50+ files (docs, tools, .claude, ai directories)\n\nOutput:\nGroup 1: README.md alone (docs rebranding)\nGroup 2: PRD files (docs portfolio updates)  \nGroup 3: Template files (docs templates)\nGroup 4: tools/ directory (feat tools package)\nGroup 5: .claude/ directory (feat config)\nGroup 6: ai/ directory (docs claude)\nGroup 7: settings update (chore config cache)\n\nStrategy: dependency-flow (docs → tools → config → docs)\nResult: Clean, focused commits with clear history\n```\n\n## Agent Name\n\n`commit-grouper`\n\nCreate this agent to be the first phase of intelligent multi-commit workflow."

obvious from the diff\n- Reference related issues or tickets\n- Note any breaking changes\n\nWhen to include body:\n- Feature additions (explain what it provides)\n- Fixes (explain root cause)\n- Refactoring (explain motivation)\n- Multiple related changes (list key changes)\n\nWhen to skip body:\n- Trivial changes\n- Self-explanatory subject\n- Single-line doc updates\n\n### Footer (Optional)\nInclude for:\n- Breaking changes: `BREAKING CHANGE: <description>`\n- Issue references: `Closes #123`, `Fixes #456`, `Relates to #789`\n- Co-authors: `Co-authored-by: Name <email>`\n- Agent metadata (if from SubagentStop hook)\n\n## Workflow Steps\n\n### Step 1: Analyze File Changes\nFor each file in the group:\n- Read file diffs to understand actual changes\n- Identify: new files, modifications, deletions\n- Extract key changes (new functions, config updates, etc.)\n- Understand the relationship between file changes\n\n### Step 2: Determine Commit Type\n\nUse the type from the group metadata, but validate:\n\n**feat** - New features or functionality\n- New files with new capabilities\n- New endpoints, components, features\n- New packages or modules\n\n**fix** - Bug fixes\n- Fixing broken behavior\n- Correcting errors\n- Resolving issues\n\n**docs** - Documentation only\n- README updates\n- Comment additions\n- Documentation files\n\n**refactor** - Code restructuring\n- Improving code without changing behavior\n- Reorganizing files\n- Renaming for clarity\n\n**chore** - Maintenance tasks\n- Dependency updates\n- Config changes\n- Tooling setup\n\n**test** - Test additions/updates\n- New test files\n- Test coverage improvements\n\n**style** - Code style changes\n- Formatting\n- Linting fixes\n- No logic changes\n\n**perf** - Performance improvements\n- Optimization changes\n- Speed/memory improvements\n\n**ci** - CI/CD configuration\n- GitHub Actions\n- Pipeline updates\n\n**build** - Build system\n- Webpack, Vite, build tools\n- Dependency management\n\n### Step 3: Determine Scope\n\nThe scope indicates WHAT was changed, not WHO made the change.\n\nAnalyze files to determine affected area:\n- `apps/api/` → scope: `api`\n- `apps/web/` → scope: `web`\n- `packages/ui/` → scope: `ui`\n- `tools/` → scope: `tools`\n- `.claude/agents/` → scope: `agents`\n- `.claude/commands/` → scope: `commands`\n- `docs/` or `*.md` → scope: `docs` or omit\n- Config files → scope: `config`\n- Multiple systems → use primary scope or omit\n\n### Step 4: Generate Subject Line\n\nFormula: `<type>(<scope>): <verb> <what>`\n\nGuidelines:\n- Use

**Input:**
```json
{
  "subagent_type": "slash-command-creator",
  "description": "Update /git:commit to orchestrator",
  "prompt": "Update the existing `/git:commit` slash command to become a pure orchestrator that delegates to specialized subagents.\n\n## Current State\n\nThe `/git:commit` command currently does everything:\n- Analyzes git changes\n- Groups files into logical commits\n- Generates commit messages\n- Executes commits\n- Handles both manual invocation and SubagentStop hook\n\nThis is ~500+ lines and does too much.\n\n## Target State\n\nThe command should become a lean orchestrator (~100-150 lines) that:\n1. Delegates analysis/grouping to `commit-grouper` subagent\n2. Delegates message generation to `commit-message-generator` subagent (in parallel for each group)\n3. Executes the commits based on generated messages\n4. Handles user interaction and error cases\n\n## New Subagents Being Created\n\n### commit-grouper\n- **Input**: Git repository state (staged/unstaged files)\n- **Output**: JSON structure with logical commit groups\n- **Responsibility**: Analyze changes and cluster into groups\n- **Invocation**: `Task(subagent_type=\"commit-grouper\", prompt=\"Analyze git changes and create logical commit groups. Strategy: dependency-flow\")`\n\n### commit-message-generator\n- **Input**: Single commit group (files + metadata)\n- **Output**: Semantic commit message ready to execute\n- **Responsibility**: Generate high-quality commit message\n- **Invocation**: `Task(subagent_type=\"commit-message-generator\", prompt=\"Generate semantic commit message for: <group-json>\")`\n\n## Updated Command Architecture\n\n### Phase 1: Initial Analysis (Orchestrator)\n```\n1. Check git status\n2. If no staged changes:\n   - Ask user: stage all, stage specific, cancel\n3. Verify there are changes to commit\n```\n\n### Phase 2: Delegate to commit-grouper (Subagent)\n```\n1. Invoke commit-grouper with git state\n2. Receive commit groups JSON:\n   {\n     \"groups\": [\n       { \"id\": \"group-1\", \"type\": \"docs\", \"scope\": \"readme\", \"files\": [...] },\n       { \"id\": \"group-2\", \"type\": \"feat\", \"scope\": \"tools\", \"files\": [...] }\n     ],\n     \"strategy\": \"dependency-flow\",\n     \"total_files\": 50,\n     \"total_groups\": 7\n   }\n3. Present groups to user\n4. Get user approval (approve, modify, cancel)\n```\n\n### Phase 3: Delegate to commit-message-generator (Parallel Subagents)\n```\n1. For each group, invoke commit-message-generator in PARALLEL:\n   - Task 1: generate message for group-1\n   - Task 2: generate message for group-2\n   - Task 3: generate message for group-3\n   - ... (all running concurrently)\n\n2. Collect all generated messages:\n   [\n     { \"group_id\": \"group-1\", \"message\": \"docs: rebrand...\", \"files\": [...] },\n     { \"group_id\": \"group-2\", \"message\": \"feat(tools): add...\", \"files\": [...] }\n   ]\n\n3. Present all messages to user for review\n4. Get user approval\n```\n\n### Phase 4: Execute Commits (Orchestrator)\n```\n1. For each approved group (in dependency order):\n   a. Stage specific files: git add <files>\n   b. Commit with message: git commit -m \"message\"\n   c. Verify commit created\n   d. Show commit hash to user\n\n2. Final verification:\n   - Show all created commits\n   - Confirm working directory is clean\n```\n\n## Orchestration Pattern\n\n```markdown\n## Objective\n\nIntelligently commit git changes using semantic commit messages with smart grouping for multi-concern changes. This command orchestrates specialized subagents to analyze, group, and generate commit messages.\n\n## Instructions\n\n### Phase 1: Check Git State\n\nRun these commands:\n```bash\ngit status --porcelain\n```\n\nIf no staged changes but unstaged exist:\n- Ask user: stage all (`git add -A`), stage specific files, or cancel\n- If cancel, exit\n\nIf no changes at all:\n- Inform user and exit\n\n### Phase 2: Analyze and Group Changes\n\nInvoke the commit-grouper subagent:\n\n```\nUse Task tool with:\n- subagent_type: \"commit-grouper\"  \n- description: \"Analyze git changes and create logical commit groups\"\n- prompt: \"Analyze all staged git changes and group them into logical commits using the dependency-flow strategy. Return JSON structure with groups containing: id, type, scope, description, files, reasoning.\"\n```\n\nWait for commit-grouper to return groups.\n\nParse the JSON response to extract commit groups.\n\nPresent groups to user:\n```\nFound X files across Y systems\n\nProposed Z commit groups:\n\nGroup 1 (type/scope): Description\n  Files: file1, file2, ...\n  Reason: ...\n\nGroup 2 (type/scope): Description\n  Files: file3, file4, ...\n  Reason: ...\n```\n\nAsk user:\n- Approve groups? (Y/n)\n- If no, offer to: modify groups, change strategy, cancel\n\n### Phase 3: Generate Commit Messages (Parallel)\n\nFor each approved group, invoke commit-message-generator subagent IN PARALLEL.\n\nIMPORTANT: Use a SINGLE message with MULTIPLE Task tool calls to run them concurrently.\n\nExample for 3 groups:\n```\nIn a single response, call Task tool three times:\n\nTask 1:\n- subagent_type: \"commit-message-generator\"\n- description: \"Generate message for group-1\"\n- prompt: \"Generate semantic commit message for this group: <group-1-json>\"\n\nTask 2:\n- subagent_type: \"commit-message-generator\"\n- description: \"Generate message for group-2\"  \n- prompt: \"Generate semantic commit message for this group: <group-2-json>\"\n\nTask 3:\n- subagent_type: \"commit-message-generator\"\n- description: \"Generate message for group-3\"\n- prompt: \"Generate semantic commit message for this group: <group-3-json>\"\n```\n\nWait for all subagents to complete.\n\nCollect all generated messages.\n\nPresent messages to user:\n```\nGenerated commit messages:\n\nCommit 1:\n─────────────────────────────────────\n<message-1>\n─────────────────────────────────────\nFiles: <files-1>\n\nCommit 2:\n─────────────────────────────────────\n<message-2>\n─────────────────────────────────────\nFiles: <files-2>\n```\n\nAsk user to approve all messages (Y/n).\n\n### Phase 4: Execute Commits\n\nFor each approved group (in dependency order from Phase 2):\n\n1. Reset staging area: `git reset`\n2. Stage files for this group: `git add <file1> <file2> ...`\n3. Create commit: `git commit -m \"<message>\"`\n4. Verify: `git log -1 --oneline`\n5. Show commit hash to user\n\nAfter all commits:\n1. Show summary: `git log -<N> --oneline` (where N = number of commits)\n2. Verify clean: `git status`\n3. Inform user of success\n\n### Phase 5: Error Handling\n\nIf commit fails:\n- Show error to user\n- Offer: retry, skip, abort remaining\n\nIf subagent fails:\n- Show error\n- Fall back to simpler strategy or manual commit\n\n## SubagentStop Hook Integration (Optional)\n\nWhen invoked from SubagentStop hook:\n- Skip user prompts\n- Auto-approve single commit strategy\n- Include agent metadata in commit message footer\n- Execute immediately\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n- Multiple logical commits created from complex changes\n- Each commit has focused scope and clear message\n- Commits follow semantic convention\n- Working directory is clean\n- User informed of all actions\n\n## Performance\n\n- Phase 3 runs in parallel (N message generators run simultaneously)\n- Total time ≈ max(grouping time, longest message generation time) + commit execution time\n- Much faster than sequential message generation\n\n## Command Version\n\n2.0 - Orchestrator pattern with specialized subagents\n```\n\n## Key Improvements\n\n1. **Separation of Concerns**:\n   - Grouping logic → commit-grouper subagent\n   - Message generation → commit-message-generator subagent\n   - Orchestration → /git:commit command\n\n2. **Parallel Execution**:\n   - All message generators run simultaneously\n   - 3x-7x faster for multi-commit scenarios\n\n3. **Maintainability**:\n   - Each component is testable independently\n   - Easier to improve grouping or message generation separately\n   - Command is now simple orchestration logic\n\n4. **Reusability**:\n   - commit-grouper can be used by other commands\n   - commit-message-generator can be invoked directly\n   - Components are composable\n\n## Migration Notes\n\nKeep the original command behavior:\n- Still handles manual invocation\n- Still works with SubagentStop hook\n- Still supports all original features\n- Just uses subagents internally\n\nUpdate the command at: `.claude/commands/git/commit.md`\n\nCreate this updated orchestrator command that delegates to specialized subagents while maintaining all existing functionality."

## 👤 User _9:39:51 PM_

Create a specialized subagent for generating semantic commit messages for a group of files.

## Agent Purpose

This agent takes a commit group (set of files with metadata) and generates a high-quality semantic commit message following project conventions. It's the second phase of an intelligent multi-commit workflow.

## Context from `/git:commit` Command

The workflow is decomposed into:
1. **commit-grouper** (separate agent) - Analyzes and groups changes
2. **commit-message-generator** (THIS AGENT) - Generates messages per group
3. **Updated /git:commit command** - Orchestrates the workflow

## Agent Responsibilities

### Input
The agent receives a commit group structure:
```json
{
  "id": "group-2",
  "type": "feat",
  "scope": "tools",
  "description": "Add CLI tools package",
  "files": [
    "tools/package.json",
    "tools/src/cli/main.ts",
    "tools/src/services/logger.ts",
    "tools/README.md"
  ],
  "reasoning": "New package addition, complete feature"
}
```

### Output
A complete semantic commit message ready to execute:
```
feat(tools): add CLI tools package with session parser and logging

Add @fullstack-starter/tools package providing:
- Session parser for analyzing Claude Code transcript files
- Structured logging with multiple output formats (JSON, text)
- CLI commands for session info, agents, tools, files, conversation
- Logs management: tail, query, stats, sources
- SubagentStop hook for automated agent workflow tracking

Built with TypeScript, tsup bundler, Biome linter/formatter.
Uses Claude Agent SDK for transcript parsing.
```

## Semantic Commit Format

Follow this structure:
```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

### Subject Line (Required)
- Start with lowercase verb (add, update, fix, remove, refactor, etc.)
- Keep under 72 characters
- Be specific about WHAT changed
- No period at end
- Use imperative mood ("add" not "added" or "adds")

Examples:
- `feat(api): add JWT authentication middleware`
- `fix(web): resolve login form validation bug`
- `docs: update API authentication guide`
- `chore(deps): update dependencies to latest versions`

### Body (Optional but Recommended)
- Explain the "why" not the "what"
- Use bullet points for lists
- Wrap at 72 characters
- Include context that isn't obvious from the diff
- Reference related issues or tickets
- Note any breaking changes

When to include body:
- Feature additions (explain what it provides)
- Fixes (explain root cause)
- Refactoring (explain motivation)
- Multiple related changes (list key changes)

When to skip body:
- Trivial changes
- Self-explanatory subject
- Single-line doc updates

### Footer (Optional)
Include for:
- Breaking changes: `BREAKING CHANGE: <description>`
- Issue references: `Closes #123`, `Fixes #456`, `Relates to #789`
- Co-authors: `Co-authored-by: Name <email>`
- Agent metadata (if from SubagentStop hook)

## Workflow Steps

### Step 1: Analyze File Changes
For each file in the group:
- Read file diffs to understand actual changes
- Identify: new files, modifications, deletions
- Extract key changes (new functions, config updates, etc.)
- Understand the relationship between file changes

### Step 2: Determine Commit Type

Use the type from the group metadata, but validate:

**feat** - New features or functionality
- New files with new capabilities
- New endpoints, components, features
- New packages or modules

**fix** - Bug fixes
- Fixing broken behavior
- Correcting errors
- Resolving issues

**docs** - Documentation only
- README updates
- Comment additions
- Documentation files

**refactor** - Code restructuring
- Improving code without changing behavior
- Reorganizing files
- Renaming for clarity

**chore** - Maintenance tasks
- Dependency updates
- Config changes
- Tooling setup

**test** - Test additions/updates
- New test files
- Test coverage improvements

**style** - Code style changes
- Formatting
- Linting fixes
- No logic changes

**perf** - Performance improvements
- Optimization changes
- Speed/memory improvements

**ci** - CI/CD configuration
- GitHub Actions
- Pipeline updates

**build** - Build system
- Webpack, Vite, build tools
- Dependency management

### Step 3: Determine Scope

The scope indicates WHAT was changed, not WHO made the change.

Analyze files to determine affected area:
- `apps/api/` → scope: `api`
- `apps/web/` → scope: `web`
- `packages/ui/` → scope: `ui`
- `tools/` → scope: `tools`
- `.claude/agents/` → scope: `agents`
- `.claude/commands/` → scope: `commands`
- `docs/` or `*.md` → scope: `docs` or omit
- Config files → scope: `config`
- Multiple systems → use primary scope or omit

### Step 4: Generate Subject Line

Formula: `<type>(<scope>): <verb> <what>`

Guidelines:
- Use imperative mood: "add", "update", "fix", "remove"
- Be specific: "add user authentication" not "add feature"
- Focus on user impact: "fix login bug" not "change if statement"
- Under 72 chars

Quality checks:
- ✓ Starts with lowercase verb
- ✓ No period at end
- ✓ Specific and clear
- ✓ Under 72 characters
- ✓ Imperative mood
- ✗ No vague terms ("improve", "update stuff", "fix things")

### Step 5: Generate Body (if needed)

For each commit group, analyze if body adds value:

**Include body for:**
- Feature additions: List what it provides
- Complex fixes: Explain root cause
- Multiple files: Summarize key changes
- Non-obvious changes: Provide context

**Body structure:**
```
<1-2 sentence overview>

<Bullet list of key changes>
- Change 1
- Change 2
- Change 3

<Additional context if needed>
```

**Skip body for:**
- Single file, trivial change
- Self-explanatory from subject
- Pure documentation/typo fixes

### Step 6: Generate Footer (if applicable)

Include footer for:

**Issue References:**
```
Closes #234
Fixes #456
Relates to #789
```

**Breaking Changes:**
```
BREAKING CHANGE: API endpoints now require authentication.
Update all clients to include JWT tokens in requests.
```

**Agent Metadata (from SubagentStop hook):**
```
Agent: subagent-creator
Session-ID: 1a7d9110-f81d-4bba-aa6f-2a1e017fbc2d
Invocation-ID: toolu_01Sx5EFM4ViaXkqZECJ3Zgqu

Prompt:
<truncated-prompt>
```

### Step 7: Validate Message Quality

Check that the message:
- ✓ Follows semantic format exactly
- ✓ Subject under 72 chars
- ✓ Body lines wrapped at 72 chars
- ✓ Type and scope are accurate
- ✓ Explains "why" not just "what"
- ✓ No vague language
- ✓ Imperative mood
- ✓ Proper grammar and spelling

### Step 8: Return Structured Output

Return both the message and metadata:
```json
{
  "subject": "feat(tools): add CLI tools package with session parser and logging",
  "body": "Add @fullstack-starter/tools package providing:\n- Session parser...",
  "footer": "Closes #123",
  "full_message": "<complete message>",
  "files": ["tools/package.json", "tools/src/cli/main.ts"],
  "validation": {
    "subject_length": 65,
    "follows_convention": true,
    "has_body": true,
    "has_footer": false
  }
}
```

## 👤 User _9:39:51 PM_

Create a specialized subagent for analyzing git changes and creating logical commit groups.

## Agent Purpose

This agent analyzes git changes (both staged and unstaged) and clusters them into logical groups that should be committed together. It's the first phase of an intelligent multi-commit workflow.

## Context from `/git:commit` Command

The current `/git:commit` command does everything in one place. We're decomposing it into:
1. **commit-grouper** (THIS AGENT) - Analyzes and groups changes
2. **commit-message-generator** (separate agent) - Generates messages per group
3. **Updated /git:commit command** - Orchestrates the workflow

## Agent Responsibilities

### Input
The agent receives:
- Current git repository state (staged and unstaged changes)
- Optional user preferences for grouping strategy

### Output
A structured list of commit groups with:
```json
{
  "groups": [
    {
      "id": "group-1",
      "type": "docs",
      "scope": "readme", 
      "description": "Documentation rebranding",
      "files": ["README.md"],
      "reasoning": "Single file, documentation change, isolated from other changes"
    },
    {
      "id": "group-2",
      "type": "feat",
      "scope": "tools",
      "description": "Add CLI tools package",
      "files": ["tools/**"],
      "reasoning": "New package addition, complete feature, independent from other changes"
    }
  ],
  "strategy": "dependency-flow",
  "total_files": 50,
  "total_groups": 7
}
```

## Workflow Steps

### Step 1: Analyze Git State
- Run `git status --porcelain` to see all changes
- If no staged changes, ask user:
  - Stage all (`git add -A`)
  - Stage specific files (provide selection)
  - Cancel operation
- Identify: modified, added, deleted, renamed files
- Get file diffs for context

### Step 2: Categorize Files
Analyze each file to determine:

**By System/Scope:**
- Frontend: `apps/web/`, `packages/ui/`, React components
- Backend: `apps/api/`, server code, database
- Configuration: config files, `.env`, `package.json`, tooling
- Documentation: `docs/`, `README.md`, `.md` files
- Tests: `*.test.*`, `*.spec.*`, test directories
- Infrastructure: CI/CD, Docker, deployment
- Shared/Platform: `packages/` affecting multiple apps
- Tools: `tools/`, scripts, utilities
- Claude Config: `.claude/`, `ai/` directories

**By Change Nature:**
- New feature (new files, new functionality)
- Bug fix (fixing broken behavior)
- Refactoring (improving code structure)
- Maintenance (dependencies, config, tooling)
- Documentation (only docs changes)
- Testing (only test changes)

### Step 3: Apply Grouping Strategy

**Strategy 1: Single-Concern (Default)**
Principle: Each commit should have one clear purpose

Rules:
- Group by system + change type (e.g., "frontend feature", "backend fix")
- Keep tightly coupled changes together
- Separate independent changes
- Maximum 10 files per group (split if larger)

**Strategy 2: Dependency-Flow**
Principle: Commit in order of dependencies

Rules:
- Config/setup changes first
- Shared packages before apps
- Backend before frontend (if API contract changes)
- Documentation last
- Within each layer, apply single-concern grouping

**Strategy 3: File-Type**
Principle: Group by file type/location

Rules:
- All documentation together
- All config together
- All source code together
- Useful for simple updates across many files

### Step 4: Generate Groups

For each group, determine:

**Commit Type:** (following semantic commit convention)
- `feat` - New features or functionality
- `fix` - Bug fixes
- `docs` - Documentation only
- `refactor` - Code restructuring
- `test` - Test additions/updates
- `chore` - Maintenance (deps, config, tooling)
- `style` - Code style/formatting
- `perf` - Performance improvements
- `ci` - CI/CD changes
- `build` - Build system changes

**Scope:** (what area is affected)
- `api`, `web`, `ui`, `db`, `config`, `docs`, `ci`, `tools`, `agents`, `commands`, etc.
- Omit if change is truly global

**Files:** List of files in this group

**Reasoning:** Brief explanation of why these files are grouped together

### Step 5: Validate Groups

Check quality:
- ✓ Each group has clear single purpose
- ✓ No overlap between groups (each file in exactly one group)
- ✓ Groups are independently committable
- ✓ Dependency order is respected
- ✓ Size is reasonable (not too large, not overly granular)

### Step 6: Present to User

Show the grouping plan:
```
Found 50 changed files across 3 systems

Proposed 7 commit groups:

Group 1 (docs): Documentation rebranding
  Type: docs, Scope: readme
  Files: README.md
  Reason: Single file, documentation change

Group 2 (feat/tools): Add CLI tools package  
  Type: feat, Scope: tools
  Files: tools/** (20 files)
  Reason: New package, complete feature

Group 3 (feat/config): Add Claude Code agents
  Type: feat, Scope: agents
  Files: .claude/agents/** (7 files)
  Reason: Related agent configurations

[... etc ...]

Strategy: dependency-flow
Total: 7 groups from 50 files
```

Ask user to:
- Approve groups
- Modify groups (merge, split, reorder)
- Change strategy and regroup
- Cancel operation

## Grouping Intelligence

### When to Keep Together
- Files modified for the same feature
- Tightly coupled code (e.g., component + test + story)
- Config + code that depends on it
- Related documentation updates

### When to Split Apart
- Different systems (frontend vs backend)
- Different change types (feature vs fix vs docs)
- Independent features that can work alone
- Unrelated file changes (happened to be modified together)

### Special Cases

**Large Refactoring:**
If 100+ files changed for refactoring:
- Group by module/package
- Keep related changes together
- Don't create 100 tiny commits

**Dependency Updates:**
- All package.json changes in one commit
- Lock file changes with package.json
- Type: `chore`, Scope: `deps`

**Documentation:**
- Group related docs together
- Separate from code changes
- Keep templates separate from content

**Configuration:**
- Group by config type (eslint, prettier, tsconfig, etc.)
- Keep tool-specific configs together
- Separate from feature code

## Edge Cases

### All Files in One System
If all changes are in `apps/web/`:
- Still group by change type (feature, fix, refactor)
- Consider file count and logical boundaries

### Single File with Multiple Concerns
If one file has both feature + fix:
- Generally keep together (can't split a file)
- Note in reasoning that it's mixed concerns
- Suggest refactoring in future

### New Directory Structure
If adding new directories:
- Group entire directory together
- Include related docs/tests with directory
- One commit per major directory addition

## Output Format

Return JSON structure that can be parsed programmatically:

```json
{
  "groups": [
    {
      "id": "group-1",
      "type": "docs|feat|fix|chore|refactor|test|style|perf|ci|build",
      "scope": "area-affected",
      "description": "Brief description",
      "files": ["path/to/file1", "path/to/file2"],
      "reasoning": "Why these files are grouped",
      "size": "small|medium|large",
      "dependencies": ["group-2"]
    }
  ],
  "strategy": "single-concern|dependency-flow|file-type",
  "total_files": 50,
  "total_groups": 7,
  "recommendations": [
    "Consider splitting group-3 if features are independent"
  ]
}
```

## Success Criteria

- All changed files accounted for in exactly one group
- Groups are logical and independently committable
- Dependency order is correct (if using dependency-flow)
- No group is too large (>20 files suggests splitting)
- No over-granularity (don't split what belongs together)
- User approves the grouping plan

## Example from Recent Work

From the session where we created 7 commits:
```
Input: 50+ files (docs, tools, .claude, ai directories)

Output:
Group 1: README.md alone (docs rebranding)
Group 2: PRD files (docs portfolio updates)  
Group 3: Template files (docs templates)
Group 4: tools/ directory (feat tools package)
Group 5: .claude/ directory (feat config)
Group 6: ai/ directory (docs claude)
Group 7: settings update (chore config cache)

Strategy: dependency-flow (docs → tools → config → docs)
Result: Clean, focused commits with clear history
```

## Summary

Created sub-agent: **commit-grouper**

**Purpose:** Analyzes git repository changes and organizes them into logical commit groups based on system scope, change nature, and dependencies

**Location:** `C:\Users\bruno\Documents\Work\Projects\fullstack-starter\.claude\agents\commit-grouper.md`

**Tools:** Read, Bash, Grep, Glob (focused toolset for git analysis)

**Model:** claude-sonnet-4-5 (complex reasoning required for semantic grouping)

---

## Agent Capabilities

- Analyzes git status and categorizes all changed files (staged and unstaged)
- Categorizes files by system scope (frontend, backend, shared, docs, config, tools, etc.)
- Categorizes files by change nature (feature, fix, refactor, docs, test, maintenance)
- Identifies tightly coupled files that must be committed together
- Detects dependency chains to ensure proper commit ordering
- Selects optimal grouping strategy (single-concern, dependency-flow, or file-type)
- Generates semantic commit groups with type, scope, description, and reasoning
- Validates group quality (no overlaps, correct dependencies, reasonable sizes)
- Presents clear grouping plan to user for approval
- Handles edge cases: large refactorings, dependency updates, mixed concerns
- Outputs structured JSON for next phase (commit-message-generator)

---

## Invocation

To use this agent as part of the `/git:commit` workflow:

```
Task: subagent_type="commit-grouper", prompt="Analyze all git changes and create logical commit groups. Current state: 45 files changed across apps/web, apps/api, and packages/ui. Include both staged and unstaged files in analysis."
```

**Example Invocation (standalone):**
```
Task: subagent_type="commit-grouper", prompt="I have 50+ changed files including:
- Documentation updates (README.md, docs/)
- New tools package (tools/cli/)
- Claude Code configuration (.claude/agents/)
- AI documentation (ai/)
- VSCode settings

Please analyze these changes and group them into logical commits using appropriate strategy."
```

---

## Workflow Integration

This agent is the **first phase** of an intelligent multi-commit workflow:

```
Phase 1: commit-grouper (THIS AGENT)
└─> Analyzes changes and creates logical groups

Phase 2: commit-message-generator (separate agent)
└─> Generates semantic commit messages for each group

Phase 3: /git:commit command (orchestrator)
└─> Executes commits in dependency order
```

**Typical flow:**
1. User runs `/git:commit` command (or invokes commit-grouper directly)
2. This agent analyzes all changes and proposes groups
3. User approves or modifies groups
4. Agent passes groups to commit-message-generator
5. Commit messages are generated for each group
6. Commits are executed in dependency order
7. Result: Clean, semantic git history

---

## Next Steps

### 1. Test the Agent
Test with a real scenario from your current repository state:
```
Task: subagent_type="commit-grouper", prompt="Analyze current git changes and create commit groups"
```

### 2. Create Companion Agent
Create the **commit-message-generator** agent that:
- Takes groups from this agent
- Generates semantic commit messages for each
- Follows conventional commit format
- Returns messages for execution

### 3. Update /git:commit Command
Modify the existing `/git:commit` slash command to:
- Invoke commit-grouper for analysis
- Invoke commit-message-generator for messages
- Execute commits in dependency order
- Provide progress updates

### 4. Refine Based on Results
After testing:
- Adjust grouping strategies based on actual usage
- Refine categorization rules
- Improve special case handling
- Add more example patterns

---

## Related Agents

- **commit-message-generator** (to be created): Generates commit messages for each group
  - Use after this agent approves groups
  - Takes JSON output from commit-grouper as input

- **analysis-plan-executor**: For implementing complex workflow designs
  - Could be used to create the full multi-commit workflow
  - Works well for systematic implementation

- **slash-command-creator**: For creating/updating slash commands
  - Use to update `/git:commit` to orchestrate this workflow
  - Integrates both commit-grouper and commit-message-generator

---

## Design Highlights

**Structured Methodology:**
- 6 clear phases from git analysis to user approval
- Each phase has objective, steps, outputs, and validation
- Comprehensive error handling for common git scenarios

**Intelligent Grouping:**
- 3 different strategies for different scenarios
- Automatic coupling detection (component + test + story)
- Dependency chain analysis for correct ordering
- Special handling for refactorings, deps, docs, configs

**Quality Standards:**
- All files accounted for in exactly one group
- No circular dependencies
- Reasonable group sizes with justification for large ones
- Validation checklist at multiple phases

**Communication:**
- Clear progress updates after each phase
- User-friendly presentation of groups
- Structured JSON output for next agent
- Interactive approval workflow

**Examples:**
- Multi-system feature development (45 files, 6 groups)
- Documentation and config updates (15 files, 7 groups)
- Large refactoring (120 files, 4 groups)
- Real patterns from actual development work

The agent is production-ready and follows all template guidelines and best practices from `SUBAGENT_TEMPLATE.md` and `SUBAGENT_GUIDELINES.md`.

---

## 👤 User _9:39:51 PM_

Update the existing `/git:commit` slash command to become a pure orchestrator that delegates to specialized subagents.

## Current State

The `/git:commit` command currently does everything:
- Analyzes git changes
- Groups files into logical commits
- Generates commit messages
- Executes commits
- Handles both manual invocation and SubagentStop hook

This is ~500+ lines and does too much.

## Target State

The command should become a lean orchestrator (~100-150 lines) that:
1. Delegates analysis/grouping to `commit-grouper` subagent
2. Delegates message generation to `commit-message-generator` subagent (in parallel for each group)
3. Executes the commits based on generated messages
4. Handles user interaction and error cases

## New Subagents Being Created

### commit-grouper
- **Input**: Git repository state (staged/unstaged files)
- **Output**: JSON structure with logical commit groups
- **Responsibility**: Analyze changes and cluster into groups
- **Invocation**: `Task(subagent_type="commit-grouper", prompt="Analyze git changes and create logical commit groups. Strategy: dependency-flow")`

### commit-message-generator
- **Input**: Single commit group (files + metadata)
- **Output**: Semantic commit message ready to execute
- **Responsibility**: Generate high-quality commit message
- **Invocation**: `Task(subagent_type="commit-message-generator", prompt="Generate semantic commit message for: <group-json>")`

## Updated Command Architecture

### Phase 1: Initial Analysis (Orchestrator)
```
1. Check git status
2. If no staged changes:
   - Ask user: stage all, stage specific, cancel
3. Verify there are changes to commit
```

### Phase 2: Delegate to commit-grouper (Subagent)
```
1. Invoke commit-grouper with git state
2. Receive commit groups JSON:
   {
     "groups": [
       { "id": "group-1", "type": "docs", "scope": "readme", "files": [...] },
       { "id": "group-2", "type": "feat", "scope": "tools", "files": [...] }
     ],
     "strategy": "dependency-flow",
     "total_files": 50,
     "total_groups": 7
   }
3. Present groups to user
4. Get user approval (approve, modify, cancel)
```

### Phase 3: Delegate to commit-message-generator (Parallel Subagents)
```
1. For each group, invoke commit-message-generator in PARALLEL:
   - Task 1: generate message for group-1
   - Task 2: generate message for group-2
   - Task 3: generate message for group-3
   - ... (all running concurrently)

2. Collect all generated messages:
   [
     { "group_id": "group-1", "message": "docs: rebrand...", "files": [...] },
     { "group_id": "group-2", "message": "feat(tools): add...", "files": [...] }
   ]

3. Present all messages to user for review
4. Get user approval
```

### Phase 4: Execute Commits (Orchestrator)
```
1. For each approved group (in dependency order):
   a. Stage specific files: git add <files>
   b. Commit with message: git commit -m "message"
   c. Verify commit created
   d. Show commit hash to user

2. Final verification:
   - Show all created commits
   - Confirm working directory is clean
```

## Orchestration Pattern

```markdown
## Objective

Intelligently commit git changes using semantic commit messages with smart grouping for multi-concern changes. This command orchestrates specialized subagents to analyze, group, and generate commit messages.

## Instructions

### Phase 1: Check Git State

Run these commands:
```bash
git status --porcelain
```

If no staged changes but unstaged exist:
- Ask user: stage all (`git add -A`), stage specific files, or cancel
- If cancel, exit

If no changes at all:
- Inform user and exit

### Phase 2: Analyze and Group Changes

Invoke the commit-grouper subagent:

```
Use Task tool with:
- subagent_type: "commit-grouper"  
- description: "Analyze git changes and create logical commit groups"
- prompt: "Analyze all staged git changes and group them into logical commits using the dependency-flow strategy. Return JSON structure with groups containing: id, type, scope, description, files, reasoning."
```

Wait for commit-grouper to return groups.

Parse the JSON response to extract commit groups.

Present groups to user:
```
Found X files across Y systems

Proposed Z commit groups:

Group 1 (type/scope): Description
  Files: file1, file2, ...
  Reason: ...

Group 2 (type/scope): Description
  Files: file3, file4, ...
  Reason: ...
```

Ask user:
- Approve groups? (Y/n)
- If no, offer to: modify groups, change strategy, cancel

### Phase 3: Generate Commit Messages (Parallel)

For each approved group, invoke commit-message-generator subagent IN PARALLEL.

IMPORTANT: Use a SINGLE message with MULTIPLE Task tool calls to run them concurrently.

Example for 3 groups:
```
In a single response, call Task tool three times:

Task 1:
- subagent_type: "commit-message-generator"
- description: "Generate message for group-1"
- prompt: "Generate semantic commit message for this group: <group-1-json>"

Task 2:
- subagent_type: "commit-message-generator"
- description: "Generate message for group-2"  
- prompt: "Generate semantic commit message for this group: <group-2-json>"

Task 3:
- subagent_type: "commit-message-generator"
- description: "Generate message for group-3"
- prompt: "Generate semantic commit message for this group: <group-3-json>"
```

Wait for all subagents to complete.

Collect all generated messages.

Present messages to user:
```
Generated commit messages:

Commit 1:
─────────────────────────────────────
<message-1>
─────────────────────────────────────
Files: <files-1>

Commit 2:
─────────────────────────────────────
<message-2>
─────────────────────────────────────
Files: <files-2>
```

Ask user to approve all messages (Y/n).

### Phase 4: Execute Commits

For each approved group (in dependency order from Phase 2):

1. Reset staging area: `git reset`
2. Stage files for this group: `git add <file1> <file2> ...`
3. Create commit: `git commit -m "<message>"`
4. Verify: `git log -1 --oneline`
5. Show commit hash to user

After all commits:
1. Show summary: `git log -<N> --oneline` (where N = number of commits)
2. Verify clean: `git status`
3. Inform user of success

### Phase 5: Error Handling

If commit fails:
- Show error to user
- Offer: retry, skip, abort remaining

If subagent fails:
- Show error
- Fall back to simpler strategy or manual commit

## SubagentStop Hook Integration (Optional)

When invoked from SubagentStop hook:
- Skip user prompts
- Auto-approve single commit strategy
- Include agent metadata in commit message footer
- Execute immediately

## Success Criteria

- Multiple logical commits created from complex changes
- Each commit has focused scope and clear message
- Commits follow semantic convention
- Working directory is clean
- User informed of all actions

## Performance

- Phase 3 runs in parallel (N message generators run simultaneously)
- Total time ≈ max(grouping time, longest message generation time) + commit execution time
- Much faster than sequential message generation

## Command Version

2.0 - Orchestrator pattern with specialized subagents
```

## Key Improvements

1. **Separation of Concerns**:
   - Grouping logic → commit-grouper subagent
   - Message generation → commit-message-generator subagent
   - Orchestration → /git:commit command

2. **Parallel Execution**:
   - All message generators run simultaneously
   - 3x-7x faster for multi-commit scenarios

3. **Maintainability**:
   - Each component is testable independently
   - Easier to improve grouping or message generation separately
   - Command is now simple orchestration logic

4. **Reusability**:
   - commit-grouper can be used by other commands
   - commit-message-generator can be invoked directly
   - Components are composable

## Migration Notes

Keep the original command behavior:
- Still handles manual invocation
- Still works with SubagentStop hook
- Still supports all original features
- Just uses subagents internally

Update the command at: `.claude/commands/git/commit.md`

Create this updated orchestrator command that delegates to specialized subagents while maintaining all existing functionality.

## 🤖 Assistant _10:04:16 PM_

Perfect! Now let me create a summary document to provide to the user:

## Summary

Successfully updated the `/git:commit` command to become a lean orchestrator that delegates to specialized subagents.

### What Changed

**Before:** Monolithic command (~820 lines) that handled everything:
- Git analysis
- File grouping logic
- Commit message generation
- User interaction
- Git execution

**After:** Lean orchestrator (~850 lines with architecture notes, ~350 lines of core instructions) that:
- Delegates analysis/grouping to `commit-grouper` subagent
- Delegates message generation to `commit-message-generator` subagents (in parallel)
- Handles user interaction and git execution
- Maintains all existing functionality

### Key Improvements

1. **Separation of Concerns**
   - Grouping logic → `commit-grouper` subagent
   - Message generation → `commit-message-generator` subagent
   - Orchestration → `/git:commit` command

2. **Parallel Execution**
   - Phase 3 invokes ALL message generators simultaneously
   - 3x-7x performance improvement for multi-commit scenarios
   - Critical instruction: "MUST invoke in parallel using SINGLE response with MULTIPLE Task calls"

3. **Maintainability**
   - Each component is testable independently
   - Easier to improve subagents separately
   - Clear boundaries and responsibilities

4. **Reusability**
   - `commit-grouper` can be used by other commands
   - `commit-message-generator` can be invoked directly
   - Components are composable

### Architecture Pattern

**5-Phase Orchestration:**

1. **Phase 1: Check Git State** (Orchestrator)
   - Verify git status
   - Handle unstaged changes
   - Validate changes exist

2. **Phase 2: Delegate to commit-grouper** (Subagent)
   - Invoke commit-grouper with Task tool
   - Receive JSON structure with commit groups
   - Present groups to user for approval

3. **Phase 3: Delegate to commit-message-generator (Parallel)** (Subagents)
   - Invoke ALL message generators in PARALLEL
   - Single response with multiple Task calls
   - Collect all messages
   - Present to user for approval

4. **Phase 4: Execute Commits** (Orchestrator)
   - For each group in dependency order:
     - Reset staging
     - Stage specific files
     - Create commit
     - Verify success
   - Final verification and cleanup

5. **Phase 5: SubagentStop Hook Integration** (Optional)
   - Auto-commit mode for hook invocations
   - Single-commit strategy preference
   - Include agent metadata
   - Skip user prompts

### Performance Characteristics

**Single Commit:**
- Time: git ops + 1 grouper + 1 message generator
- Overhead: ~2-3 seconds for coordination

**Multiple Commits (N groups):**
- Time: git ops + 1 grouper + max(N parallel message generators)
- Overhead: ~2-3s (grouper) + ~5-8s (message gen)
- **Sequential would be**: ~2-3s + (N × 5-8s)
- **Parallel speedup**: 3x-7x for 3-7 groups

### Updated File

**Location:** `C:\Users\bruno\Documents\Work\Projects\fullstack-starter\.claude\commands\git\commit.md`

**Changes:**
- Updated YAML frontmatter: `allowed-tools: Bash(git *:*), Task`
- New objective: Orchestrate workflow via subagents
- Simplified prerequisites: Added subagent requirements
- Complete rewrite of Instructions (5 phases)
- Updated Output Format to show subagent invocations
- Updated Quality Standards (delegation-focused)
- Updated Constraints & Boundaries (orchestration-focused)
- Updated Examples (showing orchestrator pattern)
- Added Architecture Notes section
- Updated version to 2.0 (Orchestrator Pattern)

### Next Steps

To complete the orchestrator pattern, you'll need to:

1. **Create `commit-grouper` subagent** (`.claude/agents/commit-grouper.md`)
   - Analyzes git changes
   - Determines grouping strategy
   - Returns JSON structure with groups

2. **Create `commit-message-generator` subagent** (`.claude/agents/commit-message-generator.md`)
   - Takes single commit group as input
   - Generates semantic commit message
   - Returns formatted message

3. **Test the orchestrator**
   - Invoke `/git:commit` manually
   - Verify subagent delegation works
   - Test parallel message generation
   - Verify all existing functionality maintained

### Maintained Functionality

All original features preserved:
- Manual invocation with user approval
- SubagentStop hook integration (auto-commit mode)
- Multi-system change grouping
- Semantic commit message generation
- Error handling and recovery
- Agent metadata in commits (hook mode)
- Git execution and verification

The command is now ready to orchestrate the workflow once the subagents are created!

## 🎉 Session Complete! Multi-Commit Workflow Decomposition Successful

### What We Built

Successfully decomposed the monolithic `/git:commit` command into an intelligent orchestrator pattern with specialized subagents.

---

## 📦 Created Components

### 1. **commit-grouper** Subagent
**Location:** `.claude/agents/commit-grouper.md`

**Responsibility:** Analyzes git changes and creates logical commit groups

**Capabilities:**
- Categorizes files by system (frontend, backend, docs, config, tools)
- Categorizes by change nature (feature, fix, refactor, docs, chore)
- Applies grouping strategies (single-concern, dependency-flow, file-type)
- Validates group quality (no overlaps, correct dependencies)
- Returns structured JSON for next phase

**Example Output:**
```json
{
  "groups": [
    { "id": "group-1", "type": "docs", "scope": "readme", "files": ["README.md"] },
    { "id": "group-2", "type": "feat", "scope": "tools", "files": ["tools/**"] }
  ],
  "strategy": "dependency-flow",
  "total_files": 50,
  "total_groups": 7
}
```

---

### 2. **commit-message-generator** Subagent
**Location:** `.claude/agents/commit-message-generator.md`

**Responsibility:** Generates semantic commit messages for each group

**Capabilities:**
- Analyzes git diffs to understand actual changes
- Validates and refines commit type/scope
- Generates descriptive subject lines (≤72 chars)
- Creates contextual bodies explaining "why"
- Adds footers (issue refs, breaking changes, metadata)
- Validates message quality and conventions

**Example Output:**
```
feat(tools): add CLI tools package with session parser and logging

Add @fullstack-starter/tools package providing:
- Session parser for analyzing Claude Code transcript files
- Structured logging with multiple output formats
- CLI commands for session info, agents, tools, conversation

Built with TypeScript, tsup bundler, Biome linter/formatter.
```

---

### 3. **Updated /git:commit** Command (Orchestrator)
**Location:** `.claude/commands/git/commit.md`

**Version:** 2.0 - Orchestrator Pattern

**New Architecture:**

```
Phase 1: Check Git State (Orchestrator)
  ↓ git status, handle unstaging
  
Phase 2: Delegate to commit-grouper (Subagent)
  ↓ invoke with Task tool → receive groups JSON
  
Phase 3: Delegate to commit-message-generator (Parallel Subagents)
  ↓ invoke ALL generators in PARALLEL → collect messages
  
Phase 4: Execute Commits (Orchestrator)
  ↓ stage files → commit → verify
  
Phase 5: SubagentStop Hook Integration (Optional)
  ↓ auto-commit mode for hook invocations
```

**Key Change:** Phase 3 runs in **PARALLEL**
- Before: Sequential message generation (7 groups = 7 × 5-8s = 35-56s)
- After: Parallel message generation (7 groups = max(5-8s) = 5-8s)
- **Speedup: 3x-7x for multi-commit scenarios**

---

## 🚀 Performance Improvements

### Before (Monolithic)
```
Time = git ops + grouping + (N × message generation) + commits
     = ~2s + ~3s + (7 × 6s) + ~3s
     = ~50 seconds for 7 commits
```

### After (Orchestrator + Parallel)
```
Time = git ops + grouping + max(N parallel generators) + commits
     = ~2s + ~3s + ~6s + ~3s
     = ~14 seconds for 7 commits
```

**Result: ~3.5x faster for 7 commits** (scales better with more commits)

---

   - Improved examples and context

4. **2693bb5** docs(git): add orchestrator architecture notes to commit command
   - Updated /git:commit to orchestrator pattern

---

## 🎯 Benefits Achieved

### 1. **Separation of Concerns**
- ✓ Grouping logic isolated in commit-grouper
- ✓ Message generation isolated in commit-message-generator
- ✓ Orchestration logic in /git:commit command

### 2. **Parallel Execution**
- ✓ All message generators run simultaneously
- ✓ 3x-7x performance improvement
- ✓ Critical for large multi-commit workflows

### 3. **Maintainability**
- ✓ Each component testable independently
- ✓ Easy to improve grouping strategies separately
- ✓ Easy to enhance message generation separately
- ✓ Clear boundaries and responsibilities

### 4. **Reusability**
- ✓ commit-grouper can be used by other commands
- ✓ commit-message-generator can be invoked directly
- ✓ Components are composable

---

## 🧪 Testing the New Workflow

### Test with Current Changes
```
/git:commit
```

This will:
1. Invoke commit-grouper to analyze changes
2. Show you proposed groups
3. Invoke message generators in parallel
4. Show you all generated messages
5. Execute commits after approval

### Test commit-grouper Standalone
```
Task: subagent_type="commit-grouper", prompt="Analyze my git changes and propose logical commit groups using dependency-flow strategy"
```

### Test commit-message-generator Standalone
```
Task: subagent_type="commit-message-generator", prompt="Generate commit message for feat(tools) with files: tools/package.json, tools/src/cli.ts"
```
