Warmup

## ðŸ¤– Assistant _3:03:37 PM_

I'm Claude Code, ready to help you with this fullstack-starter project. I've reviewed the system context and understand the principles:

**Key Operating Principles:**
- Evidence-based reasoning over assumptions
- Code-first approach with SOLID principles
- Task-first methodology: Understand â†’ Plan â†’ Execute â†’ Validate
- Parallel tool execution for efficiency
- Scope discipline - build only what's asked
- Professional honesty with realistic assessments

**Project Context:**
- Location: C:\Users\bruno\Documents\Work\Projects\fullstack-starter
- Git repo (main branch, clean status)
- Recent work: Agent refactoring, slash-command-writer migration, writer agents for creation/updates

**My Approach:**
1. Discovery first - analyze before recommending changes
2. Batch operations in parallel when possible
3. Follow existing project patterns and conventions
4. Validate with evidence (testing, metrics, code inspection)
5. Maintain session context across operations

I'm ready to:
- Search codebases efficiently with glob/grep patterns
- Read and analyze file contents
- Identify dependencies and relationships
- Plan systematic changes with parallelization analysis
- Execute with validation gates

What would you like me to help you with in this project?

Add our tools entry point to our main pnpm package.json commands, so we can call `pnpm tools <tools arguments here>` from the root directory

I'll help you add a tools entry point to the main pnpm package.json. Let me first explore the current structure to understand how the tools are organized.

## ðŸ¤– Assistant _3:35:02 PM_

Perfect! I can see that:
1. This is a pnpm workspace with `tools` included
2. The tools package has a `tools` script that runs `node dist/cli/main.js`

Now I'll add a `tools` command to the root package.json that delegates to the tools workspace:

## ðŸ¤– Assistant _3:35:34 PM_

Done! I've added the `tools` command to the root package.json at line 29. 

Now you can run `pnpm tools <args>` from the root directory, and it will delegate to the tools workspace and execute the CLI with your arguments.

For example:
- `pnpm tools session info`
- `pnpm tools logs tail`
- `pnpm tools --help`

Note: The tools need to be built first (tools/dist/cli/main.js must exist). If you haven't built them yet, run `pnpm --filter @fullstack-starter/tools build` or `pnpm build` from the root to build all packages including tools.
