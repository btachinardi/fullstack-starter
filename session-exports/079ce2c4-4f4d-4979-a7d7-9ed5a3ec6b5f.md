I can see you've run the `/git:commit` command. Let me execute the intelligent commit workflow using the orchestrator pattern.

---

## ðŸ”§ Tool: Bash _10:21:29 PM_

**Command:** `git status --porcelain`
**Description:** Check git status for changes

---

## âœ… Tool Result _10:21:31 PM_

```
 M .claude/settings.local.json
 M tools/src/hooks/subagent-stop.ts
```

## ðŸ¤– Assistant _10:21:34 PM_

I can see there are 2 modified files. Let me check if these are staged or unstaged:

---

## ðŸ”§ Tool: Bash _10:21:34 PM_

**Command:** `git status`
**Description:** Get detailed git status

---

## âœ… Tool Result _10:21:37 PM_

```
On branch main
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 14 commits.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   .claude/settings.local.json
	modified:   tools/src/hooks/subagent-stop.ts

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

---

## ðŸ¤– Assistant _10:21:41 PM_

Found 2 unstaged files:
- `.claude/settings.local.json`
- `tools/src/hooks/subagent-stop.ts`

Would you like me to stage these changes and proceed with the intelligent commit workflow? I can:

1. **Stage all changes** - Add both files and analyze them for commit grouping
2. **Stage specific files** - Choose which files to include
3. **Cancel** - Exit without committing

Which would you prefer?
