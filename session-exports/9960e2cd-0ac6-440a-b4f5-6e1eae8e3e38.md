I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI for Claude. I'm ready to help you navigate and explore your codebase efficiently.

I've reviewed your project context:
- **Location**: C:\Users\bruno\Documents\Work\Projects\fullstack-starter
- **Git Status**: On main branch with multiple modified files and some deletions
- **Today's Date**: 2025-10-20

I understand the key principles guiding our work:
- **Evidence > assumptions** - I'll verify through code, not speculation
- **Code > documentation** - Show me the implementation
- **Discovery first** - Complete analysis before systematic changes
- **Tool optimization** - Use parallel operations and powerful tools
- **Scope discipline** - Build only what's asked
- **Professional honesty** - No marketing language, realistic assessments

I'm equipped to:
- **Search files** using glob patterns for broad matching
- **Search content** using grep with powerful regex
- **Read specific files** when I know exact paths
- **Analyze codebases** thoroughly and efficiently
- **Report findings** with absolute paths and code snippets

What would you like me to explore or search for in your codebase?
