## 🤖 Assistant _9:02:45 PM_

Based on the staged changes, I can see this is a significant refactoring that involves:

1. **Cleanup of deprecated files** - Removing old `.claude-code/` directory files and test files
2. **Documentation reorganization** - Moving and updating slash command guidelines and templates
3. **Command restructuring** - Reorganizing git commands into namespaced structure
4. **Tools enhancement** - Adding logging service and logs tool functionality
5. **Hook improvements** - Updating subagent-stop hook implementation

This represents a consolidation and improvement of the development tooling infrastructure.

## 🔧 Tool: Bash _9:02:51 PM_

**Command:** `git add -A && git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
refactor: consolidate and enhance development tooling infrastructure

Remove deprecated .claude-code files and reorganize slash command documentation into ai/claude/commands directory. Restructure git commands with namespace support (git/commit.md) and update agent creator commands.

Add comprehensive logging infrastructure with new logger service and logs tool for improved debugging. Enhance subagent-stop hook with better session parsing and error handling.

Clean up test artifacts and deprecated Python/shell scripts for subagent commit management. Update tools package with new dependencies and improved CLI structure.

This consolidation improves maintainability by centralizing documentation, enhancing tooling capabilities, and removing obsolete code.
