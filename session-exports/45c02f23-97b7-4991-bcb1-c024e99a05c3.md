## 🤖 Assistant _5:43:33 PM_

Fixed! The PRD index document at `docs/prd/starter/index.md:7` has been reordered in ascending order (PRD-01 through PRD-05) in both the summary table and the detailed sections. The PRDs now flow logically from foundation (workspace setup) to packages, then applications, and finally to workflow/CI/CD.

---

## 👤 User _5:45:46 PM_

Now, from the index, it looks like PRD-02 is leaking into PRD-03/04's scopes by defining UI components (shadcn/ui), OpenAPI, Storybook, etc.

I want you to help me keep each PRD withing it's correct scope and responsibilities.

---

## 🧠 Assistant (thinking) _5:46:24 PM_

> The user is pointing out that PRD-02 (Shared Configuration & Platform Packages) seems to be overreaching into the scopes of PRD-03 (Web Application Shell) and PRD-04 (API Application Shell) by defining things like UI components, OpenAPI clients, Storybook, etc.
> 
> Let me think about the correct scope boundaries:
> 
> **PRD-01: Workspace Bootstrapping & Toolchain**
> - Monorepo setup, toolchain (Node, pnpm, Turborepo)
> - Bootstrap scripts, dev containers, environment validation
> - Git hooks, security scans
> - Core infrastructure that everything else depends on
> 
> **PRD-02: Shared Configuration & Platform Packages**
> - This SHOULD be about shared configs and platform abstractions
> - Config packages for ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript, Jest, etc.
> - Platform packages that wrap third-party libraries (TanStack, NestJS, Prisma, BullMQ)
> - The question is: should it include UI components and data clients?
> 
> **PRD-03: Web Application Shell (apps/web)**
> - The actual web application
> - Uses the packages from PRD-02
> - Should this define the UI library? Or should PRD-02?
> 
> **PRD-04: API Application Shell (apps/api)**
> - The actual API application
> - Uses packages from PRD-02
> - Implements endpoints
> 
> Looking at PRD-02's current scope:
> - "Drop-in `@starter/config-*` presets (including Vite) for ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript, Jest, Playwright, and Storybook." - This seems correct
> - "Unified `@starter/ui` with Shadcn components, tokens, layout shells, and DataTable composite wired for List Endpoint contract." - This could be seen as leaking into web app territory
> - "Platform packages encapsulating TanStack Router/Query/Store/DevTools, Simple Auth, NestJS, Prisma, BullMQ, and Redis behind `@starter/*` facades" - This seems correct as abstraction layer
> 
> 
> - "plus generated data clients and MSW mocks" - This could be seen as leaking
> - "Storybook scenes, documentation, and examples demonstrating the end-to-end List Endpoint ↔ DataTable pattern" - This seems like it should be in the app PRDs
> 
> I'm leaning towards a clear separation of concerns. The ideal approach is to keep PRD-02 focused purely on configuration and platform-level abstractions. Specific implementations, UI components, and detailed documentation should live in the application-specific PRDs. This means stripping PRD-02 back to its core purpose of providing foundational configurations and library wrappers, leaving more specific implementations to PRD-03 and PRD-04.
> 
> The shared UI package (`@starter/ui`) introduces an interesting complexity. While monorepos often have shared UI components, we need to carefully define boundaries. OpenAPI clients seem like a good candidate for PRD-02 since they're infrastructure-level and can be used across different applications. Shadcn/UI components, however, feel more like a UI-specific implementation that should live in PRD-03.
> 
> Storybook presents another nuanced decision - it's a documentation tool that bridges implementation and infrastructure, but probably belongs closer to the application layer where actual components are being developed and demonstrated.
> 
> The core challenge is preventing PRD-02 from becoming a catch-all package. By narrowing its focus to truly cross-cutting concerns like configuration and platform abstractions, we create clearer architectural boundaries. This means moving UI-specific elements like component libraries and documentation tools into PRD-03, while keeping PRD-02 lean and focused on foundational, reusable infrastructure.
> 
> The monorepo structure reveals a key insight: `@starter/ui` belongs in `packages/` rather than being tied to a specific application. This separation ensures the UI component library remains a portable, shareable resource across different projects and contexts.
> 
> The current PRD description blends package definitions with implementation specifics, which muddies the architectural separation. By distinguishing between package-level configurations and application-specific details, we can create a more modular and maintainable project structure.
> 
> PRD-02 should focus exclusively on creating reusable packages - defining UI components, configuration tools, and platform wrappers. The actual implementation and demonstration of these packages should live in subsequent PRDs, allowing for clean separation of concerns and more flexible development workflows.
> 
> I'll systematically map out the scope boundaries by carefully examining each PRD's intended purpose. The goal is identifying precise responsibilities and preventing functional overlap between different product requirement documents.
> 
> My approach involves tracing the logical flow from package creation to implementation, ensuring each PRD has a distinct, non-redundant role in the overall system architecture.

## 🧠 Assistant (thinking) _5:47:01 PM_

> Now I've read all three PRDs. Let me analyze the scope boundaries and identify where PRD-02 is leaking into PRD-03/04:
> 
> ## Current Scope Issues
> 
> ### PRD-02 (Shared Configuration & Platform Packages) - CURRENT SCOPE:
> 1. **Config packages** - ✅ Correct (ESLint, Prettier, TS, Jest, Playwright, Storybook, Vite configs)
> 2. **UI package** - ⚠️ Includes ALL Shadcn components, tokens, layouts, DataTable composite, Storybook scenes
> 3. **Platform wrappers** - ✅ Correct (TanStack, NestJS, Prisma, BullMQ, Redis wrappers)
> 4. **Data-access package** - ⚠️ Generates OpenAPI clients, MSW mocks, Zod validators
> 5. **Utilities** - ✅ Correct (web and node utils)
> 6. **List Endpoint Contract** - ⚠️ Defines the API contract and implementation pattern
> 7. **Storybook Scenes** - ⚠️ Demonstrates end-to-end patterns
> 
> ### Where PRD-02 is Overreaching:
> 
> 1. **List Endpoint Contract Implementation** (lines 123-142 in PRD-02)
>    - PRD-02 defines the REST endpoint contract details
>    - This should be owned by PRD-04 (API shell), not PRD-02
>    - PRD-02 can define the CLIENT-SIDE contract, but not the SERVER-SIDE implementation
> 
> 2. **OpenAPI Generation** (lines 115-122 in PRD-02)
>    - PRD-02 says "Source of truth: OpenAPI emitted by Nest"
>    - But then it takes ownership of generating clients from it
>    - The OpenAPI spec GENERATION should be in PRD-04
>    - PRD-02 should only consume the spec to generate clients
> 
> 3. **Storybook Scenes** (lines 95-97, 166-168 in PRD-02)
>    - PRD-02 includes "Scenes: complete pages (list with filters, bulk actions, settings forms)"
>    - These are APPLICATION-LEVEL demonstrations
>    - Should be in PRD-03 (web app), not PRD-02 (packages)
>    - PRD-02 should provide the COMPONENTS, PRD-03 should show how to USE them
> 
> 4. **DataTable ↔ List Endpoint Wiring** (line 34, I'll analyze how PRD-02 is inappropriately connecting data table components with endpoint logic, which should be a cross-cutting concern between PRD-02 and PRD-03.
> 
> The DataTable component belongs in PRD-02's scope, but its integration with list endpoints represents an application-level implementation detail better suited for PRD-03's architectural considerations.
> 
> 5. **Example Implementations** (line 167 in PRD-02)
>    - Specific example repositories like `examples/with-vite-web` and `examples/nest-resource` are more appropriate for demonstrating application-level configurations
>    - These implementation examples should be relocated to PRD-03 or PRD-04, which focus on practical application scenarios
> 
> The core principle emerging is maintaining clear separation between package-level abstractions and application-level implementations, ensuring each product requirement document addresses its intended architectural layer.
> 
> Platform packages in PRD-02 cover foundational configurations and shared utilities, while PRD-03 concentrates on web application shell patterns and concrete usage demonstrations. This strategic division prevents scope creep and maintains modular design principles.
> 
> The API application shell in PRD-04 will handle core infrastructure responsibilities like endpoint contract definition, OpenAPI specification generation, and providing authoritative resource implementations. Documentation becomes a critical focus, ensuring clear technical guidance for developers interacting with the system.
> 
> Specific modifications streamline each product requirement document's focus: PRD-02 narrows to pure package generation, PRD-03 emphasizes application-level integration and component showcase, and PRD-04 centralizes API contract and documentation management.
> 
> The key strategic shift involves precise ownership delineation, moving specific technical artifacts like List Endpoint Contract and OpenAPI specifications into a dedicated, comprehensive API application shell definition.

---

## 🤖 Assistant _5:48:27 PM_

I've created a comprehensive scope analysis at `docs/prd/starter/scope-analysis.md:1`. Here are the key findings:

## Main Issues

**PRD-02 is overreaching** by trying to be both a package provider AND an application demonstrator:

1. **List Endpoint Contract** (PRD-02 → should be PRD-04)
   - PRD-02 currently defines the server-side API contract
   - Should be: PRD-04 owns the contract, PRD-02 only consumes it

2. **OpenAPI Generation** (ambiguous ownership)
   - Should be: PRD-04 generates spec, PRD-02 consumes it to generate clients

3. **Storybook Scenes** (PRD-02 → should be PRD-03)
   - PRD-02 includes complete page demonstrations
   - Should be: PRD-02 shows components, PRD-03 shows page compositions

4. **Application Examples** (PRD-02 → should be PRD-03/04)
   - PRD-02 provides `examples/with-vite-web` and `examples/nest-resource`
   - Should be owned by respective app PRDs

5. **DataTable Wiring** (PRD-02 → should be PRD-03)
   - PRD-02 mixes component definition with application integration
   - Should be: PRD-02 provides component, PRD-03 demonstrates wiring

## Correct Data Flow

```
PRD-04 (API) → Defines contract + Generates OpenAPI spec
       ↓
PRD-02 (Packages) → Consumes spec + Generates typed clients
       ↓
PRD-03 (Web) → Uses clients + Demonstrates patterns
```

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Review** the analysis document
2. **Approve** scope changes
3. **Update** PRD documents to clarify boundaries
4. **Move** artifacts to correct ownership

Would you like me to proceed with updating the PRDs to fix these scope issues?

## 👤 User _5:55:15 PM_

First, help me understand what is the purpose of PRD-02 when we already have the specific PRD-03/04s

---

## 🧠 Assistant (thinking) _5:55:27 PM_

> Great question! The user is asking about the fundamental purpose of PRD-02 when PRD-03 and PRD-04 already exist for the specific applications. This is a crucial architectural question.
> 
> Let me think through the purpose of PRD-02:
> 
> **PRD-02 is about SHARED PACKAGES** - it's the reusable infrastructure layer that both apps consume. The key value propositions are:
> 
> 1. **Abstraction Layer**: Encapsulates third-party dependencies (TanStack, NestJS, Prisma, etc.) so apps don't import them directly
> 2. **Standardization**: Ensures both web and API apps use the same patterns, configs, and utilities
> 3. **DRY Principle**: Shared code lives in packages, not duplicated across apps
> 4. **Upgrade Path**: Can swap underlying libraries without touching app code
> 5. **Governance**: Single source of truth for platform decisions
> 
> Without PRD-02, every app would:
> - Import third-party libraries directly
> - Duplicate configs
> - Reinvent utilities
> - Diverge in patterns
> - Make upgrading dependencies painful
> 
> Let me also check if the user might be seeing PRD-02 as redundant because it's overreaching into app territory (which we just identified). The analysis shows PRD-02 is trying to do too much (application demonstrations, end-to-end patterns), which might make it seem overlapping with PRD-03/04.
> 
> The core purpose should be clearer once we fix the scope issues.

---

## 🤖 Assistant _5:56:10 PM_

Excellent question. Let me clarify the fundamental purpose and value of PRD-02.

## PRD-02's Core Purpose: The Abstraction & Standardization Layer

**PRD-02 exists to solve a specific problem that PRD-03/04 cannot solve individually:**

### The Problem Without PRD-02

If we only had PRD-03 and PRD-04:

```typescript
// apps/web - imports third-party libs directly
import { useQuery } from '@tanstack/react-query'
import { createRouter } from '@tanstack/react-router'
import { Button } from 'shadcn/ui'

// apps/api - imports third-party libs directly
import { Controller } from '@nestjs/common'
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'
import { Queue } from 'bullmq'
```

**Problems:**
1. ❌ **Duplication**: Both apps duplicate configs (ESLint, TypeScript, Vite, etc.)
2. ❌ **Divergence**: Apps evolve different patterns for same problems
3. ❌ **Upgrade Hell**: Upgrading TanStack/Nest requires touching all app code
4. ❌ **No Governance**: Can't enforce "one way" across apps
5. ❌ **Vendor Lock-in**: Apps tightly coupled to third-party APIs

---

## PRD-02's Value: The "@starter/*" Abstraction

With PRD-02, apps import from a unified vocabulary:

```typescript
// apps/web - imports from @starter/* only
import { useResourceQuery } from '@starter/data-access'
import { createAppRouter } from '@starter/platform-router'
import { Button, DataTable } from '@starter/ui'

// apps/api - imports from @starter/* only
import { createController } from '@starter/platform-api'
import { db } from '@starter/platform-db'
import { createQueue } from '@starter/platform-queue'
```

**Benefits:**
1. ✅ **Single Source of Truth**: One config package, not N config copies
2. ✅ **Enforced Patterns**: Can't deviate because the abstraction guides you
3. ✅ **Upgrade Independence**: Swap TanStack v6 → v7 in packages, apps unaffected
4. ✅ **Shared Vocabulary**: `@starter/*` becomes the team's language
5. ✅ **ESLint Boundaries**: Prevent apps from importing third-party libs directly

---

## Concrete Example: Config Packages

**Without PRD-02:**
```
apps/
  web/
    eslint.config.js (200 lines, custom rules)
    tsconfig.json (50 lines, custom paths)
    vite.config.ts (100 lines, plugins, etc.)
  api/
    eslint.config.js (180 lines, different rules 😱)
    tsconfig.json (60 lines, different strictness 😱)
    nest-cli.json (custom build settings)
  mobile/
    eslint.config.js (190 lines, yet more drift 😱)
    tsconfig.json (55 lines, inconsistent 😱)
```

**With PRD-02:**
```
packages/
  config-eslint/
    index.js (200 lines, ONE TRUTH)
  config-ts/
    base.json (50 lines, ONE TRUTH)
  config-vite/
    index.ts (100 lines, ONE TRUTH)

apps/
  web/
    eslint.config.js → extends '@starter/eslint-config'
    tsconfig.json → extends '@starter/tsconfig'
    vite.config.ts → import { defineConfig } from '@starter/vite-config'
  api/
    eslint.config.js → extends '@starter/eslint-config'
    tsconfig.json → extends '@starter/tsconfig'
```

**Impact:** Config drift eliminated, upgrades happen in ONE place.

---

## Concrete Example: Platform Abstractions

**Without PRD-02:**
```typescript
// apps/web/src/features/users/list.tsx
import { useQuery } from '@tanstack/react-query'
import { createColumnHelper } from '@tanstack/react-table'

// Every developer reinvents:
// - Query key factories
// - Error handling
// - Retry logic
// - Cache invalidation
// - Table state management
// - URL sync patterns
```

**With PRD-02:**
```typescript
// apps/web/src/features/users/list.tsx
import { useResourceQuery, queryKeys } from '@starter/data-access'
import { DataTable } from '@starter/ui'

// Just use the blessed pattern:
const { data, error, isLoading } = useResourceQuery(
  queryKeys.users.list(filters)
)

<DataTable 
  data={data} 
  columns={columns}
  // All the hard stuff (pagination, filtering, URL sync) is encapsulated
/>
```

**Impact:** Developers ship features, not infrastructure.

---

## Why Not Just Documentation?

You might ask: "Why not just write docs on how to use TanStack/Nest?"

**Answer:** Documentation is passive, packages are active enforcement.

| Approach | Can Drift? | Can Be Ignored? | Enforced by Tools? |
|----------|------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Documentation** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| **@starter/* packages** | ❌ No | ❌ No (ESLint boundaries) | ✅ Yes |

Packages encode decisions as code, making "the right way" the easiest way.

---

## The Relationship: PRD-02 ↔ PRD-03/04

Think of them as layers:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ PRD-03: apps/web (CONSUMER)                 │
│ - Demonstrates patterns                     │
│ - Imports only from @starter/*              │
│ - Ships domain features                     │
└─────────────────┬───────────────────────────┘
                  │ imports
                  ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ PRD-02: packages/* (PROVIDER)               │
│ - Defines @starter/* packages               │
│ - Encapsulates third-party libs             │
│ - Provides configs, components, utilities   │
└─────────────────┬───────────────────────────┘
                  │ wraps
                  ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Third-party libraries                       │
│ - TanStack, Shadcn, NestJS, Prisma, etc.   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**PRD-02 is the translation layer** between "the ecosystem" and "your apps."

---

## Current Problem: PRD-02 Scope Creep

Your instinct is correct—there IS redundancy, but it's **not PRD-02 existing**, it's **PRD-02 doing PRD-03/04's job**.

**PRD-02 should:**
- ✅ Provide DataTable COMPONENT
- ✅ Provide typed data-access CLIENT generator
- ✅ Provide config packages

**PRD-02 should NOT:**
- ❌ Show how to BUILD a list page (that's PRD-03)
- ❌ Define API endpoint contracts (that's PRD-04)
- ❌ Provide Storybook Scenes of complete apps (that's PRD-03)

Once we fix the scope (per the analysis), PRD-02 will be clearly distinct:
- **PRD-02** = "Here are the building blocks"
- **PRD-03** = "Here's how to build a web app with those blocks"
- **PRD-04** = "Here's how to build an API with those blocks"

---

## Real-World Analogy

Think of building a house:

- **PRD-02** = The lumberyard (provides lumber, nails, tools)
- **PRD-03** = The model home (shows how to build a house with those materials)
- **PRD-04** = The garage blueprint (shows how to build a garage with those materials)

You wouldn't ask "why do we need a lumberyard when we have house plans?" because:
- The lumberyard provides REUSABLE materials
- The plans show how to ASSEMBLE them
- Multiple builders can use the same lumberyard but build different structures

---

## The Key Test: Multiple Apps

Imagine you're building:
- `apps/web` (customer-facing SPA)
- `apps/admin` (internal admin dashboard)
- `apps/mobile` (React Native app)
- `apps/api` (REST API)
- `apps/worker` (background job processor)

**Without PRD-02:** Each app duplicates configs, wrappers, utilities → 5× duplication

**With PRD-02:** All apps import from `@starter/*` → 0× duplication

PRD-02's value compounds with each new app.

---

## Summary

**PRD-02 exists to:**
1. Eliminate duplication across apps
2. Enforce standardization via code (not just docs)
3. Create an upgrade buffer (swap libraries without touching apps)
4. Provide a shared vocabulary for the team
5. Encode platform decisions as reusable packages

**The current confusion comes from scope creep**, not PRD-02's existence. Once we fix the boundaries (packages vs. applications), the purpose will be crystal clear.

Does this clarify the role of PRD-02? Should we proceed with cleaning up the scope?

> 2. PRD-02 creates packages (needs PRD-04's OpenAPI for data-access generation)
> 3. PRD-04 uses PRD-02's packages to build API and generates OpenAPI spec
> 4. PRD-03 uses PRD-02's packages and PRD-04's API
> 
> 
> 5. PRD-05 orchestrates comprehensive CI/CD workflows across all project domains, ensuring seamless automation and integration.
> 
> The apparent circular dependency between PRD-02 and PRD-04 is actually a nuanced, manageable interaction. Different package scopes within PRD-02 consume PRD-04's specification without creating a true dependency conflict, allowing for clean, modular architecture.

   - Removed List Endpoint contract definition → Moved to PRD-04
   - Removed Storybook Scenes → Moved to PRD-03
   - Removed application examples → Moved to PRD-03/04
   - Clarified role as **package provider only**

2. **PRD-03** (`prd-03-web-application-shell.md`) - 11 sections updated
   - Added Storybook Scenes ownership (Section 4.8)
   - Added application examples ownership (Section 4.9)
   - Clarified role as **application demonstrator**

3. **PRD-04** (`prd-04-api-application-shell.md`) - 15 sections updated
   - Added List Endpoint contract definition (Section 4.3.1)
   - Added OpenAPI generation ownership (Section 4.4)
   - Added application examples ownership (Section 4.9)
   - Clarified role as **contract authority**

4. **Index** (`index.md`) - Updated all PRD summaries with corrected scopes

5. **Analysis Documents** Created:
   - `scope-analysis.md` - Original problem analysis and recommendations
   - `dependency-validation.md` - Final validation of all dependency chains

---

## Key Changes

### PRD-02: Packages (The Abstraction Layer)
**Before:** Trying to be packages + demonstrator  
**After:** Pure package provider

- Provides reusable components (DataTable as primitive)
- Consumes OpenAPI from PRD-04 for client generation
- No application-level demonstrations

### PRD-03: Web App (The Demonstrator)
**Before:** Just a shell  
**After:** Complete reference implementation

- **Owns Storybook Scenes** (complete page compositions)
- **Owns application examples** (`examples/with-vite-web`)
- Demonstrates DataTable ↔ API integration

### PRD-04: API App (The Contract Authority)
**Before:** Implements contract from PRD-02  
**After:** **Defines** contracts, generates OpenAPI

- **Owns List Endpoint contract** definition
- **Generates OpenAPI spec** for PRD-02
- Provides API endpoints to PRD-03

---

## Validated Data Flow

```
PRD-04 (apps/api)
  ↓ Defines contracts, generates OpenAPI spec
PRD-02 (@starter/data-access)
  ↓ Consumes OpenAPI, generates typed clients
PRD-03 (apps/web)
  ↓ Uses clients, demonstrates patterns
```

✅ **No circular dependencies**  
✅ **Clear ownership boundaries**  
✅ **Testable handoffs**  
✅ **Type-safe end-to-end**

---

## Documentation

All changes are documented in:
- ✅ `docs/prd/starter/scope-analysis.md` - Analysis & recommendations
- ✅ `docs/prd/starter/dependency-validation.md` - Final validation
- ✅ Updated PRD documents with clarified scopes
- ✅ Updated index with corrected summaries

The PRDs are now **ready for implementation** with clear, non-overlapping responsibilities!
