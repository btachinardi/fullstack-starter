## 🤖 Assistant _11:23:12 AM_

I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI for Claude, and I'm ready to help you search and explore your codebase!

I can see you're working in a fullstack-starter project (located at `C:\Users\bruno\Documents\Work\Projects\fullstack-starter`) on the main branch. The repository has recent commits related to agents and CI pipeline validation.

I'm equipped to help you:
- **Find files** using glob patterns for broad matching
- **Search code contents** with powerful regex patterns
- **Read specific files** when you know their paths
- **Navigate your codebase** efficiently

What would you like me to search for or explore in your project? Just let me know what you're looking for, and I'll help you find it quickly.

/git:commit

Subagent context (from SubagentStop hook):
- Agent: slash-command-creator
- Session ID: bd3084ef-10aa-4097-b095-6b897880446d
- Invocation ID: toolu_016KZmi7ta9hXfJLgZWVphWJ

Prompt:
Create a new slash command called `/dev:validate` that orchestrates all validation subagents to check and fix all problems in the project.

**Command Requirements:**

**Name:** `/dev:validate`
**Location:** `.claude/commands/dev/validate.md` (create the dev/ subdirectory if it doesn't exist)

**Purpose:**
A comprehensive validation command that runs all project quality checks and systematically fixes all issues. This command orchestrates the three validation agents (lint-debugger, test-debugger, ci-debugger) to ensure the entire project is in a clean, committable state.

**Workflow:**
The command should follow this orchestration pattern:

1. **Initial Assessment Phase:**
   - Run quick checks to identify which areas have issues
   - Determine which agents need to be invoked based on failures
   - Provide user with a summary of what will be fixed

2. **Systematic Fixing Phase (in priority order):**
   - **Option A (Full CI approach - RECOMMENDED):** 
     - Invoke the `ci-debugger` agent which handles everything (bootstrap, lint, typecheck, test, build, security)
     - The ci-debugger will automatically delegate to lint-debugger and test-debugger when appropriate
     - This ensures all jobs pass in the correct dependency order
   
   - **Option B (Individual agents approach):**
     - First invoke `lint-debugger` agent to fix all linting and type-checking issues
     - Then invoke `test-debugger` agent to fix all test failures
     - Finally run `pnpm build` to ensure project builds successfully
     - This is faster but doesn't validate the full CI pipeline

3. **Final Validation Phase:**
   - Run `pnpm ci:local` to confirm everything passes
   - Provide comprehensive summary of all fixes applied
   - Suggest next steps (commit, create PR, etc.)

**Behavior:**
- Should be autonomous - fix issues without asking unless critical decisions needed
- Should provide clear progress updates throughout the process
- Should track all changes made for the final summary
- Should fail gracefully if any agent encounters unrecoverable errors
- Should suggest using `/git:commit` after successful validation

**User Experience:**
```
> /dev:validate

🔍 Running validation checks across the project...

📊 Assessment Complete:
- Linting: 47 errors found
- Type Checking: 23 errors found  
- Tests: 5 failures found
- Build: Not validated yet

🚀 Starting systematic validation and fixing...

[Agent orchestration happens here with progress updates]

✅ Validation Complete!

📈 Summary:
- Fixed 47 linting errors across 12 files
- Fixed 23 type errors across 8 files
- Fixed 5 test failures across 3 test suites
- Build successful - all artifacts generated
- CI pipeline: 100% passing

🎯 Next Steps:
- Your project is now in a clean, committable state
- Consider running /git:commit to commit these fixes
- All quality gates are passing
```

**Command Style:**
- Use the Task tool to invoke agents (don't use SlashCommand or Skill)
- Follow the pattern from other commands in the project
- Include clear section headers and progress indicators
- Be concise but informative
- Focus on the orchestration logic, let agents do the heavy lifting

**Special Considerations:**
- Default to **Option A (ci-debugger)** as it's more comprehensive
- Mention Option B exists for faster iterations during development
- Handle the case where everything already passes (early exit with success message)
- If CI environment tools are missing (gitleaks, cyclonedx), mention but don't fail
- Should work in both monorepo and single-project setups

**Integration:**
- This command should be the "go-to" command before any commit
- Works well with `/git:commit` command (run validate first, then commit)
- Can be used as a pre-commit hook validation step
- Useful for ensuring PR readiness

Please create this command following project conventions and best practices for slash commands.

Please analyze the staged changes and create an appropriate semantic commit message.
Since this is from a hook, auto-approve and execute the commit without user interaction.

feat(commands): add /dev:validate command for comprehensive project validation

Add new slash command `/dev:validate` that orchestrates all validation agents (ci-debugger, lint-debugger, test-debugger) to systematically check and fix all project issues until the entire CI pipeline passes.

Key features:
- Three-phase workflow: assessment, systematic fixing, final validation
- Two validation strategies: Full CI (recommended) or individual agents (faster)
- Autonomous issue fixing with clear progress tracking
- Comprehensive final report with next steps
- Integration with /git:commit workflow

The command provides complete project validation before commits/PRs, ensuring code quality and CI readiness.
