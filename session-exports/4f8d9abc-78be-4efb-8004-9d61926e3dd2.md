Now I'll create an appropriate commit message based on the staged changes and execute the commit automatically.

The changes show:
- Deletion of old `.claude-code/` agent and documentation files
- Updates to slash command and agent creator documentation
- Restructuring of git commit command (`git-commit.md` → `git/commit.md`)
- Deletion of Python commit scripts
- Addition of new logging infrastructure in `tools/`
- Updates to hooks, especially `subagent-stop.ts`

This is a significant refactoring focused on improving the agent and command infrastructure, particularly around logging and hook handling.

---

## 🔧 Tool: Bash _8:55:36 PM_

**Command:** `git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
refactor: streamline agent infrastructure and add logging system

Major reorganization of agent and slash command structure:
- Remove obsolete .claude-code/ files in favor of consolidated .claude/ structure
- Restructure git commands into namespaced directory (git/commit.md)
- Delete deprecated Python commit scripts in favor of TypeScript hook system
- Add comprehensive logging service (tools/src/services/logger.ts)
- Enhance subagent-stop hook with improved session handling
- Update documentation to reflect new structure and best practices
- Add logs tool for better debugging capabilities

This refactoring improves maintainability and provides better observability
through the new logging infrastructure.
