## ü§ñ Assistant _8:54:00 PM_

I'm Claude Code, ready to help you search and explore your codebase. I have access to powerful tools for finding files, searching content, and analyzing your project structure.

I can see you're in a fullstack-starter project on the main branch with recent changes across configuration files, tools, and documentation. The project appears to be a Git repository with various modifications and additions.

I'm ready to assist with:
- Finding specific files using glob patterns
- Searching code and text with regex patterns
- Reading and analyzing file contents
- Understanding your project structure

What would you like me to search for or explore in your codebase?

## üîß Tool: Bash _8:54:17 PM_

**Command:** `git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
refactor: reorganize project structure and enhance subagent hook system

Major structural improvements:
- Moved slash command templates from .claude-code/ to ai/claude/commands/
- Deleted obsolete agent creator files from .claude-code/
- Reorganized git commands into namespaced structure (git:commit)
- Removed deprecated Python and shell scripts from ai/scripts/

Enhanced subagent hook implementation:
- Added comprehensive logging service with configurable levels
- Implemented new logs tool for debugging hook execution
- Enhanced session parser with better test coverage
- Updated subagent-stop hook with improved error handling

Configuration updates:
- Updated .claude/settings.local.json with new command paths
- Modified agents/create.md and slash-command-creator.md
- Updated tools package with new dependencies

Testing artifacts:
- Added test-hook-input.json and test-subagent-hook.txt for validation
- Enhanced documentation in tools/README.md and tools/src/hooks/README.md

This consolidates the project structure, removes deprecated tooling, and
improves the subagent lifecycle management system with better logging and
debugging capabilities.
