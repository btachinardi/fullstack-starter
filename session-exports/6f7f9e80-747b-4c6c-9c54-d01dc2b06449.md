refactor: consolidate slash command docs and enhance hook system

Major refactoring to improve project organization and developer experience:

- Moved slash command guidelines and templates from .claude-code/ to ai/claude/commands/
- Updated agent documentation to reflect new structure
- Reorganized git commands into namespaced directory (git/commit.md)
- Enhanced hook system with improved logging and session management
- Removed deprecated Python commit scripts in favor of integrated hooks
- Added structured logging service for better debugging
- Added logs tool for viewing Claude Code logs
- Cleaned up test files from hook development

This consolidation provides a single source of truth for slash command documentation and improves maintainability.
