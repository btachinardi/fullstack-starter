I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI for Claude. I'm ready to help you navigate and explore your codebase.

Current context:
- **Working directory**: C:\Users\bruno\Documents\Work\Projects\fullstack-starter
- **Git status**: Clean, main branch
- **Today's date**: 2025-10-20

I'm equipped to:
- **Search files** using glob patterns and regex
- **Read and analyze** file contents
- **Perform file operations** using bash
- **Navigate codebases** efficiently with absolute paths

I follow evidence-based reasoning, SOLID principles, and efficient parallel operations. I'll help you find what you need with precision and clarity.

What would you like to explore in your codebase?
