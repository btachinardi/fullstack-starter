refactor: reorganize slash command system and improve tooling

Major reorganization of slash command infrastructure:

REMOVED:
- Obsolete .claude-code templates and agent configs (moved to .claude)
- Deprecated AI scripts (commit-subagent-changes.py, query scripts)

UPDATED:
- Migrated git:commit command to namespaced structure
- Enhanced slash-command-creator agent with improved guidelines
- Updated agent creation workflow documentation
- Improved subagent-stop hook with better session handling
- Enhanced tools with new logging service

ADDED:
- New logger service for consistent logging across tools
- Tools CLI logs command for debugging

This consolidates slash command resources into .claude directory, 
removes deprecated Python/PowerShell scripts, and improves the 
developer experience with better logging and tooling structure.
