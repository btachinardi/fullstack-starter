---

## Usage Instructions

### Invoking the Agents

**code-writer:**
```
Task: subagent_type="code-writer", prompt="Implement a user authentication service with JWT tokens. Include login, logout, and token refresh endpoints. Follow the existing API patterns in apps/api/src/ and include tests."
```

**docs-writer:**
```
Task: subagent_type="docs-writer", prompt="Create comprehensive API documentation for the authentication endpoints (login, logout, refresh). Target audience: frontend developers. Include examples and error codes."
```

**prd-writer:**
```
Task: subagent_type="prd-writer", prompt="Create a PRD for adding real-time notifications to the application. Users should receive in-app notifications for important events. Research existing notification patterns and define technical approach."
```

---

## Agent Features

All three agents include:

- Valid YAML frontmatter with all required fields
- Clear 5-phase methodology with objectives, steps, and outputs
- Comprehensive quality standards and validation checklists
- Structured communication protocol with progress updates
- Detailed behavioral guidelines aligned with project rules
- Error handling for blocked, uncertain, and completion scenarios
- Multiple practical examples demonstrating usage
- Integration points with other agents
- Measurable success metrics
- Complete template adherence

---

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Tool Access:**
   - **code-writer:** Inherits all tools (needs maximum flexibility)
   - **docs-writer:** Explicit tools (Read, Write, Grep, Glob - no execution needed)
   - **prd-writer:** Explicit tools (Read, Write, Grep, Glob - research and writing)

2. **Model Selection:**
   - All use **claude-sonnet-4-5** due to complexity of tasks
   - Code generation, technical writing, and strategic planning all require deep reasoning

3. **Auto-Commit:**
   - All set to `autoCommit: true` as they create/modify files
   - Changes should be committed when work is complete

4. **Workflow Structure:**
   - Each agent has 5 logical phases
   - Clear validation checkpoints between phases
   - Progressive from discovery to delivery

---

## Integration Examples

### Workflow: Feature Development
1. **prd-writer:** Create PRD defining feature requirements
2. **code-writer:** Implement feature based on PRD specifications  
3. **docs-writer:** Document the implemented feature

### Workflow: Code + Documentation
1. **code-writer:** Write new API endpoints
2. **docs-writer:** Create API documentation for the endpoints

### Workflow: Planning + Implementation
1. **prd-writer:** Define technical requirements for new system
2. **code-writer:** Implement system based on technical specs in PRD

---

## Next Steps

1. **Test the agents** with real scenarios to validate behavior
2. **Refine based on results** - adjust workflows or add examples as needed
3. **Share with team** if these are project-level agents
4. **Create related agents** if specialized variants needed (e.g., test-writer, refactoring-agent)

---

## Related Agents

These new agents work well with existing agents:
- **analysis-plan-executor:** Can execute plans that involve code writing or documentation
- **commit-message-generator:** Will create commits for code-writer and docs-writer changes
- **slash-command-creator:** Could create shortcuts for invoking these writers

All three agents are now ready for use and follow the official Claude Code sub-agent best practices.

---

## 🤖 Assistant _11:03:13 PM_

Perfect! I've successfully created three specialized subagents for your project:

## Created Agents

### 1. **code-writer** 
- Location: `.claude/agents/code-writer.md`
- Writes production-ready code across all languages/frameworks
- Full tool access for maximum flexibility
- Implements features, modules, tests with no placeholders

### 2. **docs-writer**
- Location: `.claude/agents/docs-writer.md`  
- Creates technical documentation, API docs, READMEs, user guides
- Tailored to target audiences with complete examples
- Uses Read/Write/Grep/Glob tools

### 3. **prd-writer**
- Location: `.claude/agents/prd-writer.md`

## Quick Usage Examples

```
# Implement a feature
Use Task tool: subagent_type="code-writer"
Prompt: "Build a JWT authentication service with login/logout/refresh endpoints"

# Document the feature  
Use Task tool: subagent_type="docs-writer"
Prompt: "Create API documentation for the auth endpoints with examples"

# Plan a new feature
Use Task tool: subagent_type="prd-writer"
Prompt: "Create PRD for real-time notifications system"
```

Each agent follows a 5-phase methodology with built-in validation, quality checks, and structured workflows. They're ready to use immediately!

## 👤 User _11:15:00 PM_

Now, let's also add a few more utility subagents:

1. research-writer: conducts research in the web and/or in the codebase for answering a question, writes the results to ai/research
2. todo-writer: generates a todo document (*.todo.md) based on a request and/or a PRD document. Breaks everything down into tasks and pre-defines a subagent to execute those.
3. test-writer: responsible for writing tests for code, like unit tests, integration, e2e, etc
4. lint-debugger: responsible for running linting/typecheck tools across the project to check if the code is correctly written, and then fixes the problems until the tools report that everything is correct.
5. test-debugger: responsible for running all of the project's tests, identifies failing tests and uses a predefined workflow to fix one failure at a time. After fixing a failure, it must run the tests again and continue iterating until all tests are passing.

You must create all of these subagents in their own Task that can run in parallel.


Then, once you are done, I want you to use the @agent-slash-command-creator for creating the `delegate` command, that is a specialist in using all of these subagents we created to perform all of the tasks it needs to be done. It must contain a list of all subagents with instructions on when and how to use them.

## 🧠 Assistant (thinking) _11:15:07 PM_

> The user wants me to:
> 1. Create 5 more utility subagents using the subagent-creator agent
> 2. Run these in parallel (so I need to use multiple Task calls in a single message)
> 3. After that's done, use the slash-command-creator agent to create a `delegate` command that knows how to use all 8 subagents
> 
> Let me break this down:
> 
> First, I'll create 5 Task calls in parallel for:
> 1. research-writer - conducts research and writes to ai/research
> 2. todo-writer - generates *.todo.md from requests/PRDs, breaks down into tasks
> 3. test-writer - writes unit/integration/e2e tests
> 4. lint-debugger - runs linting/typecheck, fixes issues iteratively
> 5. test-debugger - runs tests, fixes failures iteratively
> 
> Then after those complete, I'll use slash-command-creator to create the `delegate` command with info about all 8 subagents (the 3 we just created + these 5 new ones).
> 
> Let me prepare the parallel Task calls first.

## Summary

Created sub-agent: **lint-debugger**

**Purpose:** Runs linting and type-checking tools across the project, then iteratively fixes all issues until zero errors remain

**Location:** `C:\Users\bruno\Documents\Work\Projects\fullstack-starter\.claude\agents\validation\lint-debugger.md`

**Tools:** All tools (inherited)

**Model:** claude-sonnet-4-5

---

## Agent Capabilities

- **Tool Discovery**: Automatically identifies all linting tools (ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript, Pylint, etc.) configured in the project
- **Baseline Analysis**: Runs all tools and categorizes errors by type and priority
- **Auto-Fix Pass**: Applies automatic fixes using `--fix` flags where supported
- **Iterative Manual Fixing**: Systematically fixes remaining errors one by one
- **Continuous Validation**: Re-runs tools after each fix to ensure progress and no regressions
- **Functionality Preservation**: Runs tests to confirm fixes don't break existing behavior
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Provides detailed progress updates and final summary

---

## Invocation

To use this agent:

```
Task: subagent_type="lint-debugger", prompt="Fix all linting and type-checking errors in the project"
```

### Example Invocation:

```
Task: subagent_type="lint-debugger", prompt="The CI/CD pipeline is failing due to ESLint and TypeScript errors. Please fix all linting and type-checking issues so the build passes."
```

Or for a specific scope:

```
Task: subagent_type="lint-debugger", prompt="Fix all linting errors in the src/components directory. Focus on TypeScript type errors and ESLint violations."
```

---

## Workflow Overview

The agent follows a 5-phase workflow:

1. **Phase 1: Tool Discovery** - Identifies all linting and type-checking tools in the project
2. **Phase 2: Initial Quality Check** - Runs all tools and captures baseline error state
3. **Phase 3: Auto-Fix Pass** - Applies automatic fixes where supported (ESLint --fix, Prettier, etc.)
4. **Phase 4: Manual Fix Iteration** - Systematically fixes remaining errors one by one with validation
5. **Phase 5: Final Validation** - Confirms all tools pass with zero errors and tests still pass

---

## Key Features

**Intelligent Error Handling:**
- Prioritizes type errors over style issues
- Groups related errors in same files
- Preserves code functionality while fixing

**Comprehensive Tool Support:**
- JavaScript/TypeScript: ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript compiler
- Python: Pylint, Flake8, mypy, Black, Ruff
- Auto-detects tools from project configuration

**Quality Standards:**
- Zero errors from all tools (exit code 0)
- All tests must pass (functionality preserved)
- Minimal changes focused on fixing reported issues
- No placeholder fixes (avoids excessive use of `@ts-ignore` or rule disabling)

---

## Next Steps

1. **Test the agent** with a real scenario:
   ```
   Task: subagent_type="lint-debugger", prompt="Fix all linting errors in the project"
   ```

2. **Refine based on results** - The agent may need adjustments based on your project's specific tools and patterns

3. **Integrate into workflow** - Consider using this agent:
   - As a pre-commit quality gate
   - After major refactoring
   - When CI/CD builds fail due to linting
   - As part of code review process

4. **Add to project documentation** - Document this agent's availability for team members

---

## Related Agents

- **commit-grouper** agent: Run lint-debugger first to ensure code quality before grouping commits
- **code-writer** agent: Run lint-debugger after code generation to polish quality
- **general-purpose** agent: Can invoke lint-debugger as part of development workflows
- **git workflow** agents: Integrate as quality gate before commits

---

## Design Highlights

**Follows Best Practices:**
- ✅ Complete YAML frontmatter with all required fields
- ✅ Clear 5-phase methodology with objectives, steps, outputs, and validation
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling (blocked, uncertain, complete scenarios)
- ✅ Three detailed examples showing different use cases
- ✅ Quality standards with measurable criteria
- ✅ Communication protocol with progress updates and final report structure
- ✅ Behavioral guidelines for autonomous operation
- ✅ Integration points with other agents

**Autonomous Operation:**
- Agent can run end-to-end without user intervention for standard scenarios
- Asks for approval on config changes or major refactoring
- Provides clear progress updates throughout execution
- Delivers comprehensive final report with all changes documented

**Safety Built-In:**
- Validates after each fix to prevent regressions
- Runs tests to ensure functionality preserved
- Makes minimal changes focused on fixing errors
- Prefers proper fixes over disabling rules or using type assertions

---

The **lint-debugger** agent is ready to use and follows all project templates and best practices. It will help maintain code quality by systematically eliminating linting and type-checking errors across your codebase.

## 🤖 Assistant _11:16:22 PM_

Excellent! Now I have all the information I need. The project uses Vitest as the testing framework. Let me create the test-writer sub-agent:

## Phase 1: Requirements Analysis ✅

**Agent Purpose:** Write comprehensive tests including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests

**Requirements Analysis:**
- Purpose: Test writing specialist for all types of tests
- Tools needed: All tools (needs to read code, write tests, run test commands, search patterns)
- Model: claude-sonnet-4-5 (complex reasoning for test scenario identification and edge cases)
- Name: test-writer (unique, descriptive, kebab-case)
- Workflow phases needed: Discovery → Analysis → Test Writing → Validation → Documentation

**Validation:**
- ✅ Agent purpose is clear and specific
- ✅ Agent name is unique (not found in existing agents)
- ✅ Tool requirements identified (inherit all tools)
- ✅ Model selection appropriate (Sonnet 4.5 for complex test scenario reasoning)

## Phase 2: Template Loading and Design ✅

Templates and guidelines loaded. Now designing the agent structure:

**Workflow Design:**
1. **Phase 1: Code Discovery** - Understand code to test, identify patterns
2. **Phase 2: Test Scenario Analysis** - Identify test cases, edge cases, integration points
3. **Phase 3: Test Implementation** - Write unit, integration, and e2e tests
4. **Phase 4: Validation & Coverage** - Run tests, check coverage, validate quality
5. **Phase 5: Documentation** - Document test patterns and usage

**Quality Standards:**
- All test scenarios covered
- Tests follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Proper test isolation and mocking
- High code coverage
- Tests actually validate behavior

## Phase 3: Agent File Creation

Now I'll create the complete test-writer agent file:

## Summary

Created sub-agent: **test-writer**

**Purpose:** Write comprehensive, production-quality tests including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests with proper test isolation, mocking, and high code coverage.

**Location:** `C:\Users\bruno\Documents\Work\Projects\fullstack-starter\.claude\agents\test-writer.md`

**Tools:** All tools (inherited) - Full access including MCP servers

**Model:** claude-sonnet-4-5

---

## Agent Capabilities

- **Comprehensive Test Coverage**: Writes unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests
- **Edge Case Analysis**: Identifies and tests boundary conditions, error scenarios, and edge cases
- **Best Practices**: Follows AAA pattern (Arrange-Act-Assert), test isolation, effective mocking
- **Framework Agnostic**: Works with Vitest, Jest, Pytest, and other testing frameworks
- **High Quality Standards**: Ensures meaningful assertions, proper test isolation, and maintainable tests
- **Coverage Analysis**: Validates code coverage and identifies gaps
- **Multiple Test Types**: Unit tests for isolated functionality, integration tests for module interactions, e2e tests for workflows

---

## Invocation

To use this agent:

```
Task: subagent_type="test-writer", prompt="[Describe what needs to be tested]"
```

**Example Invocation:**

```
Task: subagent_type="test-writer", prompt="Write comprehensive tests for the UserService.createUser method in tools/src/services/user-service.ts. The method validates user input, checks for duplicate emails, hashes passwords, and creates users in the database. Include unit tests for all scenarios including happy path, validation errors, duplicate users, and database errors. Target 100% coverage for this function."
```

**Another Example:**

```
Task: subagent_type="test-writer", prompt="Create integration tests for the POST /api/auth/login endpoint. Test successful login, invalid credentials, missing fields, and rate limiting. Use the existing Vitest setup and follow the project's test patterns found in tools/src/services/session-parser.test.ts."
```

**E2E Example:**

```
Task: subagent_type="test-writer", prompt="Write end-to-end tests for the complete user registration workflow: registration form → email verification → profile setup → dashboard. Test the happy path and validation errors at each step. Use Playwright for browser automation."
```

---

## Next Steps

1. **Test the agent** with a real testing scenario from your codebase
2. **Verify test quality** by reviewing generated tests and running them
3. **Refine if needed** based on actual test output quality
4. **Integrate with workflow** by using it when implementing new features
5. **CI/CD Integration** to ensure tests run automatically

---

## Related Agents

- **code-writer**: Use code-writer to implement features, then invoke test-writer to create comprehensive tests for that code
- **docs-writer**: After test-writer creates test suites, use docs-writer to document testing strategies and patterns
- **analysis agents**: Use analysis agents to understand complex code before writing tests for it

**Workflow Pattern:**
1. User requests feature implementation
2. Main agent delegates to **code-writer** for implementation
3. After code is complete, delegate to **test-writer** for comprehensive test coverage
4. Optionally delegate to **docs-writer** for testing documentation

---

## Testing Philosophy Embedded in Agent

The test-writer agent enforces these key testing principles:

- **Behavior over Implementation**: Tests should validate behavior and contracts, not internal implementation details
- **AAA Pattern**: Consistent use of Arrange-Act-Assert for readable, maintainable tests
- **Test Isolation**: Each test is independent with proper setup/teardown
- **Meaningful Assertions**: Specific, clear assertions that validate expected behavior
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Happy paths, edge cases, error scenarios all covered
- **Mock Boundaries**: Mock external dependencies, test real logic
- **No Flaky Tests**: Deterministic, reliable tests that pass consistently
- **Documentation**: Complex test setups are documented clearly

---

**File Location (Absolute Path):**
`C:\Users\bruno\Documents\Work\Projects\fullstack-starter\.claude\agents\test-writer.md`

The test-writer agent is now ready to use! It will help you create production-quality tests that follow best practices, achieve high code coverage, and maintain code quality throughout your project's lifecycle.

## Summary

Created sub-agent: **test-debugger**

**Purpose:** Runs all project tests, identifies failures, and systematically fixes them one at a time until all tests pass

**Location:** `C:\Users\bruno\Documents\Work\Projects\fullstack-starter\.claude\agents\validation\test-debugger.md`

**Tools:** All tools (inherited) - needs Read, Write, Bash, Grep, Glob for comprehensive test debugging

**Model:** claude-sonnet-4-5 - Complex reasoning required for error analysis and root cause identification

---

## Agent Capabilities

- **Test Discovery:** Automatically identifies all test suites (unit, integration, e2e) and test frameworks
- **Failure Analysis:** Analyzes error messages, stack traces, and source code to identify root causes
- **Systematic Fixing:** Fixes one failing test at a time with minimal, targeted changes
- **Iterative Validation:** Re-runs tests after each fix to verify resolution and prevent regressions
- **Complete Coverage:** Handles Jest, Vitest, Mocha, Playwright, and other test frameworks
- **Progress Tracking:** Reports progress after each fix with clear metrics
- **100% Success:** Continues until all tests pass with zero failures

---

## Invocation

To use this agent:

```
Task: subagent_type="test-debugger", prompt="Run all tests and fix any failures"
```

### Example Invocation:

```
Task: subagent_type="test-debugger", prompt="All tests are currently failing after the recent refactoring. Please run the full test suite, identify all failures, and systematically fix them one by one until we have 100% pass rate. The project uses Jest for unit tests and Playwright for e2e tests."
```

### Specific Scenario Invocation:

```
Task: subagent_type="test-debugger", prompt="The integration tests in apps/api are failing with database connection errors. Please debug and fix these tests. Focus on the auth and user modules first as they're blocking deployment."
```

---

## Workflow Overview

The agent follows a 5-phase iterative workflow:

1. **Test Discovery** → Identifies all test suites and runs initial baseline
2. **Failure Analysis** → Analyzes one failing test at a time to find root cause
3. **Fix Implementation** → Applies minimal, targeted fix to resolve the failure
4. **Verification** → Re-runs tests to confirm fix and identify next failure
5. **Final Validation** → Confirms 100% pass rate and delivers comprehensive report

**Iteration:** Phases 2-4 repeat for each failing test until all tests pass

---

## Next Steps

1. **Test the agent with a real scenario:**
   - Invoke the agent on your current codebase
   - Provide context about which tests are failing (if known)
   - Review the fixes it applies for correctness

2. **Refine based on results:**
   - Adjust fix strategies if needed
   - Fine-tune error analysis patterns
   - Add project-specific test patterns

3. **Add to project documentation:**
   - Document in your CI/CD workflow
   - Add to troubleshooting guides
   - Include in pre-release checklist

4. **Integrate with other workflows:**
   - Use before running commit-grouper
   - Invoke after major refactoring
   - Add to pre-deployment checks

- Breaks down complex features into granular, actionable tasks (1-4 hours ideally)
- Assigns appropriate subagent to each task (code-writer, docs-writer, test-writer, User, etc.)
- Creates dependency chains and determines execution order (sequential vs. parallel)
- Identifies risks, complexity factors, and quality checkpoints
- Writes structured *.todo.md files with clear task breakdowns, phases, and acceptance criteria
- Plans for setup, implementation, testing, documentation, and deployment phases
- Includes quality standards and validation requirements

---

## Invocation

To use this agent:

**Basic Usage:**
```
Task: subagent_type="todo-writer", prompt="Create a todo for implementing user authentication with OAuth"
```

**From PRD:**
```
Task: subagent_type="todo-writer", prompt="Create a todo document for implementing the user profile customization feature. PRD is located at ai/docs/prds/user-profile-customization-prd.md. Break down all requirements into actionable tasks with appropriate subagent assignments and dependency tracking."
```

**For Bug Fix:**
```

```

---

## Next Steps

1. **Test the agent** with a real scenario:
   - Use it to generate a todo from an existing PRD
   - Or provide a feature request and see how it breaks down tasks
   
2. **Refine based on results:**
   - Adjust task granularity if too high-level or too detailed
   - Improve subagent assignment logic if mismatches occur
   
3. **Integrate with workflow:**
   - Use prd-writer → todo-writer → code-writer pipeline
   - Track progress by checking off tasks in generated todos
   
4. **Share with team:**
   - Document the agent in project README
   - Train team on how to invoke for planning work

- **analysis-plan-executor**: Executes analysis plans → May work with todo-writer for research/analysis heavy projects

## Agent Structure Highlights

**6-Phase Workflow:**
1. Requirements Analysis (understand what to build)
2. Task Decomposition (break into granular tasks)
3. Subagent Assignment (assign ownership)
4. Dependency & Execution Planning (sequence and dependencies)
5. Risk & Quality Planning (identify challenges and checkpoints)
6. Todo Document Assembly (create structured *.todo.md)

**Quality Standards:**
- Tasks are granular (1-4 hours each ideally)
- Every task has subagent assigned
- Dependencies explicitly marked
- Quality checkpoints at phase boundaries
- Risks documented upfront
- Scope boundaries clear

**Example Output Structure:**
- Metadata header (feature, date, status, timeline)
- Overview and objectives
- Prerequisites
- Phases with numbered tasks
- Acceptance criteria per phase
- Quality checkpoints
- Risks and mitigation
- Out-of-scope items

The agent is production-ready and follows all SUBAGENT_TEMPLATE.md and SUBAGENT_GUIDELINES.md best practices!

## 🧠 Assistant (thinking) _11:22:38 PM_

> The user wants me to now create a slash command called "delegate" using the slash-command-creator agent. This slash command should be a specialist in using all the subagents we just created to perform tasks.
> 
> Let me list all the subagents we've created:
> 1. code-writer - writes all types of code
> 2. docs-writer - writes all types of documentation
> 3. prd-writer - writes all types of PRDs
> 4. research-writer - conducts research and writes results to ai/research
> 5. todo-writer - generates todo documents based on requests/PRDs
> 6. test-writer - writes tests (unit, integration, e2e)
> 7. lint-debugger - runs linting/typecheck and fixes problems
> 8. test-debugger - runs tests and fixes failures
> 
> Now I need to invoke the slash-command-creator agent to create the "delegate" command that knows when and how to use all of these subagents.
> 
> The system reminder about TodoWrite is just a gentle reminder - since I'm just invoking another agent to create a slash command, I don't think a todo list is necessary here. It's a single task.

## 🤖 Assistant _11:22:39 PM_

Great! All 5 utility subagents have been created successfully. Now let me create the `delegate` slash command that specializes in using all these subagents.

## 🔧 Tool: Task _11:22:56 PM_

**Input:**
```json
{
  "subagent_type": "slash-command-creator",
  "description": "Create delegate slash command",
  "prompt": "Create a slash command named \"delegate\" that specializes in intelligently delegating tasks to the appropriate subagents.\n\n**Command Name:** delegate\n\n**Purpose:** Acts as an intelligent orchestrator that analyzes user requests and delegates work to the most appropriate specialized subagent(s). It understands when to use each subagent and can chain multiple subagents together for complex workflows.\n\n**Available Subagents to Delegate To:**\n\n1. **code-writer** - Writes production-ready code across all languages/frameworks\n   - When to use: Implementing features, creating functions, building modules, writing scripts\n   - Example: \"Implement user authentication\", \"Create API endpoints\", \"Build data processing pipeline\"\n\n2. **docs-writer** - Writes all types of documentation\n   - When to use: Creating READMEs, API docs, user guides, inline documentation\n   - Example: \"Document the authentication API\", \"Create user guide for feature X\"\n\n3. **prd-writer** - Writes Product Requirement Documents\n   - When to use: Planning new features, defining requirements, creating specifications\n   - Example: \"Create PRD for notification system\", \"Define requirements for dashboard\"\n\n4. **research-writer** - Conducts research (web/codebase) and writes findings to ai/research/\n   - When to use: Understanding technologies, finding solutions, analyzing best practices\n   - Example: \"Research how to implement WebSockets\", \"Find best practices for error handling\"\n\n5. **todo-writer** - Generates *.todo.md documents from requests/PRDs\n   - When to use: Breaking down complex features, planning execution, organizing tasks\n   - Example: \"Create todo from PRD\", \"Break down the migration into tasks\"\n\n6. **test-writer** - Writes unit, integration, and e2e tests\n   - When to use: Creating test coverage, implementing test suites\n   - Example: \"Write tests for UserService\", \"Create e2e tests for checkout flow\"\n\n7. **lint-debugger** - Runs linting/typecheck tools and fixes all issues\n   - When to use: Before commits, when CI is failing, after major changes\n   - Example: \"Fix all linting errors\", \"Clean up type errors\"\n\n8. **test-debugger** - Runs tests and fixes failures iteratively\n   - When to use: When tests are failing, after refactoring, before releases\n   - Example: \"Fix all failing tests\", \"Debug integration test failures\"\n\n**Command Behavior:**\n\nThe delegate command should:\n- Analyze the user's request to identify what type of work is needed\n- Select the most appropriate subagent(s) to handle the work\n- Chain multiple subagents when needed (e.g., prd-writer → todo-writer → code-writer → test-writer)\n- Provide clear reasoning for which subagent(s) it's delegating to\n- Handle complex workflows that require multiple specialized agents\n- Use parallel delegation when tasks are independent\n- Use sequential delegation when tasks have dependencies\n\n**Example Workflows:**\n\n1. \"Build a new feature for real-time notifications\"\n   - Delegate to: prd-writer → todo-writer → code-writer → test-writer → docs-writer\n\n2. \"Fix all code quality issues and failing tests\"\n   - Delegate to: lint-debugger + test-debugger (parallel)\n\n3. \"Research GraphQL migration and create implementation plan\"\n   - Delegate to: research-writer → prd-writer → todo-writer\n\n4. \"Add authentication and document it\"\n   - Delegate to: code-writer → test-writer → docs-writer\n\nThe command should be intelligent, concise, and act as a smart orchestrator that knows the strengths of each subagent and when to use them individually or in combination.\n\nPlease create this slash command following best practices and project templates."
