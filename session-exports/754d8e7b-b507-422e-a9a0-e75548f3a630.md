Hello! I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's file search specialist. I'm ready to help you navigate and explore your codebase efficiently.

I can see you're working in a fullstack-starter project on the main branch. Based on the git status, there have been several recent changes including modifications to CLI tools, agent configurations, and documentation.

How can I help you today? I can:
- Search for files using glob patterns
- Search file contents with regex
- Read specific files
- Help you navigate your project structure
- Find code patterns or specific functionality

What would you like to search for or explore?
