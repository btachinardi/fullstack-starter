Now I'll analyze the changes and create an appropriate commit message. Looking at the diff, this is a comprehensive refactoring that involves:

1. **Deletion of old agent/slash command files** from `.claude-code/` directory
2. **Moving and updating documentation** for slash commands to `ai/claude/commands/`
3. **Reorganizing the git:commit command** into a namespace structure
4. **Adding new logging infrastructure** to the tools package
5. **Updating tools** with better hooks and session handling
6. **Cleanup of old Python scripts** for subagent commits

This appears to be a refactoring to consolidate and improve the agent/command infrastructure with better logging and organization.

## 🔧 Tool: Bash _8:58:22 PM_

**Command:** `git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
refactor(agents): consolidate command infrastructure with improved logging

Major refactoring of the agent and slash command system to improve organization and observability:

- Migrate slash command documentation from .claude-code/ to ai/claude/ for better organization
- Restructure git-commit command into namespaced git/commit.md format
- Add comprehensive logging service to tools package for better debugging
- Enhance subagent-stop hook with improved session parsing and logging
- Remove obsolete Python commit scripts in favor of built-in tooling
- Update agent creator documentation to reflect new structure
- Add logs tool for viewing and filtering agent execution logs

This consolidation improves maintainability, provides better observability into agent execution, and establishes a clearer structure for slash commands and agent development.
