Warmup

## ðŸ¤– Assistant _2:58:52 PM_

I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI for Claude, and I'm ready to help you search through your codebase. I can see you're working in a fullstack starter project on the `main` branch.

I have access to powerful search capabilities including:
- **Glob patterns** for finding files by name/extension
- **Grep with regex** for searching file contents
- **Read** for examining specific files
- **Bash** for file operations

I also have the project instructions from `CLAUDE.md` available, which reference `@PRINCIPLES.md` and `@RULES.md` that I should follow.

I'm currently at: `C:\Users\bruno\Documents\Work\Projects\fullstack-starter`

I notice there's a staged change:
- `ai/docs/slash-command-writer-migration.md` (newly added)

And recent commits show work on agents, writer agents, utilities, and tests.

I'm warmed up and ready to help. What would you like me to search for or explore in your codebase?

/git:commit

Subagent context (from SubagentStop hook):
- Agent: subagent-creator
- Session ID: 302e7990-d417-486d-95c0-490990124dfb
- Invocation ID: toolu_01DHzWyDYzBJ9M5RFX34csWk

Prompt:
Migrate the slash-command-creator.md agent to slash-command-writer.md as a writer agent. This means:

1. **Rename**: Change name from "slash-command-creator" to "slash-command-writer"
2. **Update description**: Change to "Writes (creates and updates) optimized custom Claude Code slash commands following project templates and best practices. Use when users want to create new slash commands or improve existing ones."
3. **Generalize terminology**: Replace "create/creator/creation" language with more flexible terms:
   - "Creates" â†’ "Writes" or "Generates"
   - "Creating" â†’ "Writing" or "Generating"
   - "Creation" â†’ "Writing" or "Generation"
   - "Creator" â†’ "Writer"
   - Make it clear the agent can BOTH create new AND update existing commands
4. **Keep Edit tool**: The agent already has Edit tool which is good for updates
5. **Update methodology phases**: Make phases work for both creating new and updating existing commands
6. **Update examples**: Include examples of both creating new commands AND updating/improving existing ones

The agent should be positioned as handling all command file operations (create, update, improve), not just creation.

Source file: .claude/agents/claude/slash-command-creator.md
Target file: .claude/agents/claude/slash-command-writer.md

Remember to use the temporary file approach documented at the end of the agent file for working with .claude folder files.

Please analyze the staged changes and create an appropriate semantic commit message.
Since this is from a hook, auto-approve and execute the commit without user interaction.
