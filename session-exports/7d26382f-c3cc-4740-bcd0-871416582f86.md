Warmup

## ðŸ¤– Assistant _11:10:17 AM_

I'm ready to assist you with file searching and code exploration in your fullstack-starter project. I have access to powerful tools for:

- **Glob patterns** - Finding files by name and extension
- **Grep/Regex** - Searching file contents
- **Read** - Viewing specific file contents
- **Bash** - File operations and directory navigation

I can see you're on the `main` branch with a recent commit about adding new agents for code writing and testing. There's also a new file being tracked: `.claude/agents/validation/ci-debugger.md`

What would you like me to search for or explore in your codebase? Just let me know:
- What files or patterns you're looking for
- What code or content you want to search for
- How thorough you'd like the search to be

I'm ready when you are.

/git:commit

Subagent context (from SubagentStop hook):
- Agent: subagent-creator
- Session ID: bd3084ef-10aa-4097-b095-6b897880446d
- Invocation ID: toolu_01Szvhek2dvWJzqoDZPbPCPR

Prompt:
Create a new subagent called "ci-debugger" in the `.claude/agents/validation/` directory, similar to the existing `lint-debugger.md` and `test-debugger.md` agents.

**Agent Requirements:**

**Name:** ci-debugger
**Description:** Runs the full CI pipeline using `pnpm ci:local`, identifies all types of failures (bootstrap, lint, typecheck, test, build, security), and systematically fixes them until the entire CI pipeline passes.

**Model:** claude-sonnet-4-5 (requires complex reasoning across multiple failure types)
**autoCommit:** true

**Context to incorporate:**
1. The CI script location: `scripts/ci-local.sh`
2. The CI jobs that run (in order):
   - Setup / Bootstrap Check: `pnpm ci:bootstrap`
   - Lint: `pnpm turbo run lint --filter='./packages/*' --filter='./apps/*'`
   - Type Check: `pnpm turbo run typecheck --filter='./packages/*' --filter='./apps/*'`
   - Test: `pnpm turbo run test --filter='./packages/*' --filter='./apps/*'`
   - Build: `pnpm turbo run build`
   - Security / Gitleaks (optional if installed)
   - Security / SBOM (optional if installed)

**Agent Structure:**
Follow the same structure as lint-debugger.md and test-debugger.md:
- Core Directive
- Configuration Notes (model selection, tool access)
- Available Tools section
- Methodology with 5 phases:
  - Phase 1: CI Job Discovery and Initial Run
  - Phase 2: Failure Analysis (categorize by job type)
  - Phase 3: Fix Implementation (systematic fixing)
  - Phase 4: Verification and Iteration
  - Phase 5: Final Validation
- Quality Standards
- Communication Protocol with progress updates and final report format
- Behavioral Guidelines (decision-making, safety, scope management)
- Error Handling (when blocked, uncertain, complete)
- Examples & Patterns (at least 3 examples)
- Integration & Delegation
- Success Metrics

**Key Differences from lint-debugger:**
- This agent handles ALL CI job types, not just linting
- Must handle dependencies between jobs (e.g., can't build if types fail)
- Should prioritize fixes based on job order (fix bootstrap before lint, etc.)
- Should recognize when to delegate to specialized agents (lint-debugger for lint issues, test-debugger for test issues)
- Must handle the full CI environment simulation (CI=true, GITHUB_ACTIONS=true)
- Should check for optional security tools and skip gracefully if not installed

**Special Considerations:**
- The ci-local.sh script uses `set -e` to stop on first failure by default
- Can set `CI_FAIL_FAST=true` to stop immediately on first failure
- Should explain the difference between running individual jobs vs. full CI pipeline
- Should validate that pnpm-lock.yaml exists before running
- Should run `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` as part of the process

Please create this agent following the same high-quality, comprehensive structure as the existing validation agents.

Please analyze the staged changes and create an appropriate semantic commit message.
Since this is from a hook, auto-approve and execute the commit without user interaction.

feat(agents): add ci-debugger agent for comprehensive CI pipeline validation

Add new ci-debugger agent that runs the full local CI pipeline (pnpm ci:local),
identifies failures across all job types (bootstrap, lint, typecheck, test, build,
security), and systematically fixes them until the entire pipeline passes.

Key features:
- Handles all CI job types with priority-based fix ordering
- Delegates to specialized agents (lint-debugger, test-debugger) when appropriate
- Respects job dependencies (bootstrap â†’ types â†’ lint â†’ test â†’ build â†’ security)
- Supports CI environment simulation (CI=true, GITHUB_ACTIONS=true)
- Provides comprehensive reporting with fix summaries and validation results
- Uses claude-sonnet-4-5 for complex multi-failure reasoning
- Includes autoCommit for autonomous operation

This agent complements lint-debugger and test-debugger by providing full-stack
CI validation, making it ideal for pre-push checks and fixing CI failures.
