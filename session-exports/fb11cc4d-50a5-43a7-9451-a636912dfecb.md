âœ… **Commit created successfully!**

**Commit:** `2693bb5`  
**Type:** `docs(git)`  
**Message:** Add orchestrator architecture notes to commit command

The commit documents the new orchestrator pattern architecture for the `/git:commit` command, including:
- Related subagents (commit-grouper, commit-message-generator)
- Architecture benefits (separation of concerns, parallel execution, maintainability, reusability)
- Performance characteristics for single vs. multiple commits
- Error handling strategy
- Enhanced workflow integration with hooks

Your working tree is now clean, and you're 13 commits ahead of origin/main.
