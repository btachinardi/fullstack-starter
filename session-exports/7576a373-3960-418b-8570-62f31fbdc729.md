Warmup

## ðŸ¤– Assistant _2:41:36 PM_

I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI for Claude, and I'm ready to help you search and explore your codebase.

I see you're working in the `fullstack-starter` project on the `main` branch. The project has some recent modifications:
- Modified: `.claude/settings.local.json` and `tools/package.json`
- Added: `ai/requests/agents-tool.md`

I've also noted the project instructions reference `@PRINCIPLES.md` and `@RULES.md` files, which I can reference if needed.

I'm ready to assist you with:
- File searching using glob patterns
- Content searching with regex
- Reading and analyzing specific files
- Understanding your codebase structure

What would you like me to search for or explore in your project?

/git:commit

Subagent context (from SubagentStop hook):
- Agent: commit-message-generator
- Session ID: 01a6b79e-77f7-408d-9443-82d8a4b26da7

Prompt:
Generate a semantic commit message for this commit group:

```json
{
  "id": "group-6",
  "type": "chore",
  "scope": "claude",
  "description": "Update Claude Code settings and add agent system documentation",
  "files": [
    ".claude/settings.local.json",
    "ai/requests/agents-tool.md",
    "ai/requests/tasks-tool.md",
    "tools/package.json"
  ],
  "reasoning": "Update Claude Code settings to allow additional bash commands, and add comprehensive documentation for agent isolation system and task management tools. Tools package.json included as it's part of the tooling ecosystem."
}
```

Context: Updated Claude Code local settings to approve additional bash commands. Added documentation for the agent system and task tool. The tools package.json was modified to change the test script from "vitest" (watch mode) to "vitest run" to prevent CI hangs.

Please analyze the staged changes and create an appropriate semantic commit message.
Since this is from a hook, auto-approve and execute the commit without user interaction.
