I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI for Claude, ready to help you search and explore your codebase. I'm currently in your project directory at `C:\Users\bruno\Documents\Work\Projects\fullstack-starter`.

I can see you're on the `main` branch with some recent changes to settings, agent tools, and package configurations. I notice there are project instructions in `@PRINCIPLES.md` and `@RULES.md` that I should follow.

I'm warmed up and ready to help you with file searches, code exploration, and codebase navigation. What would you like me to search for or explore in your project?

Perfect! I can see the changes clearly. Based on the staged changes and the commit group metadata, I'll create a semantic commit message and execute the commit.

The changes include:
1. **`.claude/settings.local.json`**: Added 4 new bash command approvals (pnpm tsc, find, node, taskkill)
2. **`ai/requests/agents-tool.md`**: New comprehensive documentation for the agent isolation system (527 lines)
3. **`tools/package.json`**: Changed test script from "vitest" (watch mode) to "vitest run" to prevent CI hangs

This aligns with the commit group type "chore" with scope "claude" focusing on configuration updates and documentation additions.
