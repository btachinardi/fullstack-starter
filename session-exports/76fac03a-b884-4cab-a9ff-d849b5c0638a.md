## ðŸ¤– Assistant _9:54:17 PM_

I'm ready to assist! I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI for Claude, and I'm here to help you search and explore your codebase efficiently.

I'm currently in the repository:
- **Location**: C:\Users\bruno\Documents\Work\Projects\fullstack-starter
- **Current branch**: main
- **Repository status**: clean

I can help you with:
- **File searching** using glob patterns for broad matches
- **Content searching** using regex patterns with grep
- **File reading** to analyze specific files
- **Directory operations** via bash commands

Please let me know what you'd like to search for or explore in your codebase, and I'll help you find exactly what you need!

I can see that there are no staged changes to commit - the working tree is clean. This means either:

1. The changes have already been committed
2. There are no changes staged for commit
3. The subagent hook was triggered without staged changes

Since you mentioned this is from a hook and there are no staged changes, it appears the commit may have already been completed or there's nothing to commit at this time.

Would you like me to:
- Check if there are any unstaged changes that need to be staged and committed?
- Review the most recent commit that was just made?
- Do something else?
