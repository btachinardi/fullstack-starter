Run the @agent-context-test agent

> I need to use the Task tool to invoke this agent. Let me check the available agent types from the Task tool description. I can see there's a "context-test" agent listed:

## ğŸ‘¤ User _9:53:48 PM_

Warmup

---

## ğŸ¤– Assistant _9:53:52 PM_

I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI for Claude. I'm ready to assist you with file search, code navigation, and codebase exploration tasks.

I've reviewed the system context:
- **Working directory**: C:\Users\bruno\Documents\Work\Projects\fullstack-starter
- **Git repo**: Yes (main branch)
- **Today's date**: 2025-10-20

I understand the principles and rules governing my behavior:
- Evidence > assumptions, Code > documentation
- Task-first approach with parallel thinking where applicable
- Complete implementations, no TODOs or mock objects
- Tool optimization through batching and parallel operations
- Professional honesty and realistic assessments

I'm ready to help you navigate this codebase. What would you like me to search for or explore?

---

## ğŸ‘¤ User _9:54:17 PM_

You are the context-test agent. Your task is to verify what context you have access to and report back on:

1. What user instructions/guidelines you can see (CLAUDE.md, PRINCIPLES.md, RULES.md)
2. What project information you have access to (working directory, git status, etc.)
3. What environment information is available to you
4. Any other contextual information you can observe

Please provide a comprehensive report of what context is available to you as a subagent.

## 5. Behavioral Constraints

### âœ… Subagent-Specific Constraints
- **CWD Reset**: Agent threads have cwd reset between bash calls
- **Absolute Paths**: Must use absolute file paths only
- **No Emojis**: Must avoid using emojis for clear communication
- **Final Response**: Must share relevant filenames and code snippets with absolute paths

### âœ… Token Budget
- **Available**: 200,000 tokens

## 6. Additional Context

### âœ… Conflict Resolution Hierarchy (from RULES.md)
1. Safety First (Security/data rules always win)
2. Scope > Features
3. Quality > Speed
4. Context Matters

### âœ… Workflow Pattern Access
I understand the required workflow:
- Task Pattern: Understand â†’ Plan â†’ TodoWrite(3+ tasks) â†’ Execute â†’ Track â†’ Validate
- Batch Operations: Always parallel by default
- Validation Gates: Validate before, verify after
- Evidence-Based: All claims must be verifiable

## Conclusion

**Context Availability Score: 100%**

As a subagent, I have complete access to:
- âœ… All user global instructions (CLAUDE.md, PRINCIPLES.md, RULES.md)
- âœ… All project information (git status, working directory, recent commits)
- âœ… All environment variables (platform, date, model info)
- âœ… All tool capabilities (15 tools available)
- âœ… All behavioral constraints and guidelines
- âœ… Subagent-specific instructions and limitations

The only notable constraint is the **cwd reset between bash calls**, requiring absolute file paths. Otherwise, subagents operate with the same contextual awareness as the main Claude Code instance.

## ğŸ¤– Assistant _9:55:04 PM_

The context-test agent has completed its analysis. Here's the summary:

**Context Availability: 100%**

The subagent confirmed full access to:

âœ… **User Instructions** - All global instructions (CLAUDE.md, PRINCIPLES.md, RULES.md) are accessible
âœ… **Project Info** - Working directory, git status, recent commits all visible
âœ… **Environment** - Platform (win32), current date (2025-10-20), model info available  
âœ… **Tools** - All 15 tools accessible (Bash, Read, Edit, Write, Grep, Glob, etc.)
âœ… **Guidelines** - All workflow rules, behavioral constraints, and patterns understood

**Key Finding**: Subagents operate with the same contextual awareness as the main Claude Code instance. The only notable constraint is that the working directory resets between bash calls, requiring absolute file paths.

The agent verified it can see your current git status (8 modified files, 2 untracked including `.claude/agents/context-test.md`), recent commits, and all behavioral rules like the workflow pattern (Understand â†’ Plan â†’ TodoWrite â†’ Execute â†’ Validate) and efficiency principles (parallel operations, evidence-based reasoning, etc.).
