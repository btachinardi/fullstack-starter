I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's file search specialist. I'm ready to help you navigate and explore your codebase efficiently.

I've reviewed my context:

**Environment**: 
- Working directory: `C:\Users\bruno\Documents\Work\Projects\fullstack-starter`
- Git repo on `main` branch
- Platform: Windows (win32)

**Recent Changes**:
- Modified files: README.md, several docs/prd files
- New files: dependency-validation.md, scope-analysis.md

**My Capabilities**:
- Pattern matching with Glob and Grep tools
- File content analysis with Read tool
- Powerful codebase search and exploration
- Parallel operations for efficiency

**My Approach**:
- Evidence-based reasoning (code > assumptions)
- Efficient parallel searches
- Absolute file paths in responses
- Clear, technical communication

What would you like me to help you find in your fullstack-starter project? I can:
1. Search for specific files or patterns
2. Analyze code structure and organization
3. Trace code flow and dependencies
4. Locate configuration files and documentation
5. Find implementation examples

What's your search request?
