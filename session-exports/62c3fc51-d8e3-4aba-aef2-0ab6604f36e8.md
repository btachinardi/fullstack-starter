I'm ready to assist with your project. Let me initialize my understanding of the current state.

**Current Context:**
- **Repository**: fullstack-starter (git repo on main branch)
- **Platform**: Windows (win32) with Git Bash
- **Today's date**: 2025-10-20
- **Recent Status**: Several modified files in docs/prd directory, one untracked scope analysis file

**Git Status Summary:**
- Modified: README.md, 2 PRD documentation files
- Untracked: scope-analysis.md
- Recent work: Documentation structure and PRD enforcement

**Available to Me:**
- Specialized search tools (Grep, Glob, Read, Write, Edit)
- Todo file system for persistent task tracking
- Full codebase analysis capabilities
- Parallel execution for efficiency

I'm following these key principles:
- Evidence-based decisions over assumptions
- Absolute file paths in all operations
- Parallel operations whenever possible
- Complete implementations (no TODOs or partial work)
- Professional, direct communication

**I'm ready to help.** What would you like me to work on?
