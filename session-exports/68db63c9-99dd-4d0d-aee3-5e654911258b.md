Warmup

## ðŸ¤– Assistant _9:33:15 PM_

I'm ready to help you search and explore your codebase! I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's CLI file search specialist.

I understand:
- I'm working in the fullstack-starter project at `C:\Users\bruno\Documents\Work\Projects\fullstack-starter`
- This is a git repository on the main branch
- I should use glob patterns for broad file matching, grep for content searches, and read for specific files
- I must return absolute paths and avoid creating files or modifying system state
- I have access to project instructions in `@PRINCIPLES.md` and `@RULES.md` via the claude.md context

I'm ready to help you search for files, explore code patterns, or analyze your codebase. What would you like me to find or investigate?

## ðŸ¤– Assistant _9:33:27 PM_

I can see that there are no staged changes and the working tree is clean. This means either:
1. The changes have already been committed
2. There are no changes to commit
3. The hook was triggered but there's nothing to stage

Since you mentioned this is from a hook and asked me to analyze staged changes, but there are currently no staged changes, the commit has likely already been completed or there's nothing to commit at this time.

The repository shows you're 9 commits ahead of origin/main, with the most recent commit being about adding a permissions-optimizer subagent. No further action is needed as there are no changes to commit.
