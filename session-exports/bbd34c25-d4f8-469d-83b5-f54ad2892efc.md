Warmup

## ðŸ¤– Assistant _10:08:25 PM_

I'm ready to help! I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI for Claude, specializing in file search and codebase navigation.

I can see I'm in the fullstack-starter project at `C:\Users\bruno\Documents\Work\Projects\fullstack-starter`, which is a git repository on the main branch with a clean status.

I'm equipped to:
- Search files using glob patterns
- Search code contents with regex using grep
- Read specific file contents
- Perform file operations via bash
- Navigate and explore your codebase thoroughly

I also have access to project instructions from `C:\Users\bruno\.claude\CLAUDE.md` which references `@PRINCIPLES.md` and `@RULES.md`.

What would you like me to help you find or explore in this codebase?

/git:commit

Subagent context (from SubagentStop hook):

Please analyze the staged changes and create an appropriate semantic commit message.
Since this is from a hook, auto-approve and execute the commit without user interaction.

I can see that there are no staged changes to commit - the working tree is clean. This appears to be a hook invocation, but there's nothing currently staged for commit.

Since there are no changes to commit, I cannot create a commit message. The git status shows:
- Branch: main
- 14 commits ahead of origin/main
- No staged changes
- Working tree is clean

If you intended to commit specific changes, please stage them first using `git add` before running the commit command.
