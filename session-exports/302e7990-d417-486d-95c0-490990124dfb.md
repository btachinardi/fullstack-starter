Rewrite all creator agents `.claude/agents/**/*-creator.md` as writer agents. The main difference here is that writer agents must be instructed to both create and update files, so they must be a little bit more generalistic in their instructions terminology.


To perform the actual edits, use our current @agent-subagent-creator, in parallel tasks, one for each creator agent to migrate.

### Agent Capabilities

The new **subagent-writer** agent can now:

- Write new sub-agents from specifications
- Update existing sub-agents to meet current standards
- Refactor agents for improved clarity and functionality
- Migrate agents to new template versions
- Fix configuration and workflow issues in existing agents
- Handle both simple updates and major refactoring operations

### Invocation

To use this agent:

```
Task: subagent_type="subagent-writer", prompt="[describe what agent to write or update]"
```

**Example Invocations:**

```
Task: subagent_type="subagent-writer", prompt="Create a new agent that validates JSON schema compliance"
```

```
Task: subagent_type="subagent-writer", prompt="Update the code-quality-analyzer agent to include TypeScript-specific linting"
```

### Next Steps

1. The original `subagent-creator.md` file can be deprecated or removed
2. Test the agent with both creation and update scenarios
3. Update any documentation or commands that reference "subagent-creator" to use "subagent-writer"
4. Consider creating a slash command for common agent writing operations

### Related Files

## 🤖 Assistant _2:58:46 PM_

Perfect! Now let me create a summary of what was accomplished:

---

## Migration Complete: slash-command-creator → slash-command-writer

I've successfully migrated the `slash-command-creator` agent to `slash-command-writer`. Here's what was done:

### Key Changes

**1. Name & Description**
- Changed name from `slash-command-creator` to `slash-command-writer`
- Updated description to emphasize it handles BOTH creating AND updating commands
- New description: "Writes (creates and updates) optimized custom Claude Code slash commands following project templates and best practices."

**2. Terminology Generalization**
Throughout the agent file, replaced creator/creation language with writer/writing:
- "Creates" → "Writes" or "Generates"
- "Creating" → "Writing" or "Generating"
- "Creation" → "Writing" or "Generation"
- "Creator" → "Writer"

**3. Enhanced Methodology**
All 5 phases updated to support both new command generation and updates:
- **Phase 1:** Added operation type detection (new vs. update)
- **Phase 2:** Added preservation strategy for updates
- **Phase 3:** Added Edit tool guidance for targeted changes
- **Phase 4:** Updated file operations to handle both Write and Edit
- **Phase 5:** Added changelog documentation for updates

**4. New Example Added**
- **Example 3:** Shows how to update an existing command (validate-api-contract)
- Demonstrates using Edit tool for targeted changes
- Shows backward compatibility considerations

**5. Tool Configuration**
The agent already had the Edit tool, which is perfect for updates. Tool priority clearly defines:
- **Write:** For new commands or major rewrites
- **Edit:** For targeted updates to existing commands

### Files Created/Updated

**Created:**
- `.claude/agents/claude/slash-command-writer.md` (new agent file)
- `ai/docs/slash-command-writer-migration.md` (migration documentation)

**Requires Manual Update:**
Three files reference the old agent name and need updating:
1. `.claude/agents/git/commit-grouper.md` (line 876)
2. `.claude/agents/claude/permissions-optimizer.md` (line 758)
3. `tools/src/hooks/README.md` (line 58)

Details of required changes are in `ai/docs/slash-command-writer-migration.md`.

### Agent Positioning

The agent is now positioned as handling ALL slash command file operations:
- **Generate new commands** from scratch
- **Update existing commands** with improvements
- **Refactor commands** to follow best practices
- **Add features** to existing commands
- **Maintain quality** across all commands

This makes it more versatile and valuable for ongoing command maintenance, not just initial creation.

### Next Steps

1. Manually update the 3 files that reference the old agent name (see migration doc)
2. Optionally remove or archive `.claude/agents/claude/slash-command-creator.md`
3. Test the new agent with both creation and update scenarios
4. Update any other project documentation referencing the old name

The migration maintains full backward compatibility while adding significant new capabilities for command maintenance workflows.

## 🤖 Assistant _3:01:42 PM_

Perfect! I've successfully completed the migration of all creator agents to writer agents and updated all references throughout the codebase. Here's a summary:

## Migration Complete ✅

### New Writer Agents Created
1. **subagent-writer** (`.claude/agents/claude/subagent-writer.md`)
   - Migrated from subagent-creator
   - Now handles both creating new AND updating existing sub-agents
   - Updated terminology throughout to be more generalistic

2. **slash-command-writer** (`.claude/agents/claude/slash-command-writer.md`)
   - Migrated from slash-command-creator
   - Now handles both creating new AND updating existing slash commands
   - Already had Edit tool, now properly documented for updates

### All References Updated

**Regular files updated:**
- `tools/src/hooks/README.md` - Updated example commit from `subagent-creator` to `subagent-writer`
- `ai/docs/agent-creator-system.md` - Updated 4 references:
  - Agent name: `subagent-creator` → `subagent-writer`
  - Agent name: `command-creator` → `slash-command-writer`
  - File paths updated
  - Section title: "Updating Creator Agents" → "Updating Writer Agents"

**.claude folder files updated:**
- `.claude/commands/git/commit.md` - Updated example from `subagent-creator` to `subagent-writer`
- `.claude/agents/claude/permissions-optimizer.md` - Updated "Works Well With" section reference
- `.claude/agents/git/commit-grouper.md` - Updated "Works Well With" section reference

### Files Changed
- 7 files updated with new agent references
- 2 new writer agents created
- All references to `*-creator` agents now point to `*-writer` agents

### Next Steps
You may want to:
1. Delete or archive the old creator agent files if no longer needed
2. Test the new writer agents with both create and update scenarios  
3. Update any external documentation that might reference the old agent names

All references have been systematically updated to use the new writer agent terminology!
