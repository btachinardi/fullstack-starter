# Slash Command Writer Agent Migration

**Date:** 2025-10-21
**Operation:** Migrated slash-command-creator to slash-command-writer

## Summary

Successfully migrated the `slash-command-creator` agent to `slash-command-writer` to reflect that the agent handles both creating new commands AND updating existing ones.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Agent File Created
- **Location:** `.claude/agents/claude/slash-command-writer.md`
- **Name:** `slash-command-writer` (was: `slash-command-creator`)
- **Description:** "Writes (creates and updates) optimized custom Claude Code slash commands..." (was: "Creates...")

### 2. Terminology Updates

Updated all references from "create/creator/creation" language to more flexible terms:

- "Creates" → "Writes" or "Generates"
- "Creating" → "Writing" or "Generating"
- "Creation" → "Writing" or "Generation"
- "Creator" → "Writer"

### 3. Enhanced Capabilities

The agent now explicitly handles:
- Creating new slash commands
- Updating existing slash commands
- Improving/refactoring commands
- Adding features to commands
- Modifying command behavior

### 4. Methodology Updates

**Phase 1: Requirements Discovery**
- Added "Determine Operation Type" step to identify new vs. update
- Added "For Updates/Improvements" section with guidance
- Updated outputs to include "Operation type: new generation or update"
- Enhanced validation checklist for update scenarios

**Phase 2: Template Selection and Design**
- Added step 5: "For Updates: Preserve working elements, enhance weak areas, maintain consistency"
- Updated outputs to include "For updates: sections to preserve vs. modify"

**Phase 3: Command Content Writing**
- Changed all "Write" language to "Write/Update"
- Added step 6: "For Updates: Use Edit tool for targeted changes or Write tool for comprehensive rewrites"
- Updated validation to include backward compatibility

**Phase 4: File Writing and Validation**
- Updated to handle both "Write or Update Command File"
- Added guidance on using Edit vs Write tool for updates
- Added backward compatibility validation

**Phase 5: Documentation and Usage Instructions**
- Added "For updates: what changed and why" to usage summary
- Added "For updates: regression testing recommendations" to testing guidance
- Added "For updates: changelog summary" to outputs

### 5. Enhanced Examples

Added **Example 3: Updating Existing API Validation Command** showing:
- How to update an existing command
- Using Edit tool for targeted changes
- Maintaining backward compatibility
- Providing changelog

### 6. Quality Standards Updates

Added to Completeness Criteria:
- "For updates: changes are coherent and preserve working functionality"

Added to Validation Requirements:
- "For updates: changes are clearly documented"

### 7. Communication Protocol Updates

Progress updates now include:
- "and operation type determined" in Phase 1

Final report now includes:
- "Operation: [New command/Update to existing command]"
- "For Updates: Changes Made:" section with changelog

Testing recommendations include:
- "For updates: verify backward compatibility"

### 8. Success Metrics Updates

Added:
- "Command file generated/updated in correct location" (was just "created")
- "For updates: changes are coherent and preserve working functionality"

## Files Requiring Manual Updates

The following files reference the old agent name and should be updated:

### 1. `.claude/agents/git/commit-grouper.md` (Line 876)
**Current:**
```markdown
- **slash-command-creator** agent: For updating `/git:commit` command to use this workflow
```

**Update to:**
```markdown
- **slash-command-writer** agent: For updating `/git:commit` command to use this workflow
```

### 2. `.claude/agents/claude/permissions-optimizer.md` (Line 758)
**Current:**
```markdown
- **slash-command-creator agent:** For creating custom commands that respect new permissions
```

**Update to:**
```markdown
- **slash-command-writer agent:** For creating custom commands that respect new permissions
```

### 3. `tools/src/hooks/README.md` (Line 58)
**Current:**
```markdown
Create a new Claude Code subagent named `slash-command-creator` that
specializes in creating optimized custom slash commands...
```

**Update to:**
```markdown
Create a new Claude Code subagent named `slash-command-writer` that
specializes in writing (creating and updating) optimized custom slash commands...
```

## Next Steps

1. **Manual Updates Required:** Update the 3 files listed above to reference the new agent name
2. **Old File Cleanup:** Optionally remove or archive `.claude/agents/claude/slash-command-creator.md`
3. **Testing:** Test the new agent with both:
   - Creating a new command
   - Updating an existing command
4. **Documentation:** Update any project documentation that references the old agent name

## Agent Positioning

The agent is now positioned as the primary tool for ALL slash command file operations:
- **Create:** Generate new command files from scratch
- **Update:** Improve, refactor, or modify existing commands
- **Maintain:** Ensure commands follow current templates and best practices

This makes the agent more versatile and valuable for ongoing command maintenance, not just initial creation.
