# Agent Creator System

**Created:** 2025-10-20
**Purpose:** Meta-agent system that creates agent systems by orchestrating specialized creator agents

---

## Overview

The Agent Creator System is a meta-agent system that automates the creation of Claude Code agent systems. It demonstrates the principle of separation of concerns by using specialized sub-agents for specific creation tasks, coordinated by an orchestration command.

This system creates agent systems, which themselves consist of orchestration commands and specialized sub-agents working together to accomplish complex workflows.

## Architecture

### Orchestration Command

**`/agents:create`** - Main orchestrator that designs and builds complete agent systems
- **Location:** `.claude/commands/agents/create.md`
- **Purpose:** Coordinates the agent system creation workflow
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Requirements discovery and analysis
  - Agent system architecture design
  - Delegation to specialist creator agents
  - System integration validation
  - Documentation generation

### Specialized Sub-Agents

**`subagent-creator`** - Creates sub-agent files

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Requirements Discovery & System Design
```
User describes workflow/problem
         ↓
/agents:create analyzes requirements
         ↓
/agents:create designs agent system architecture:
  - Identifies needed capabilities
  - Maps capabilities to sub-agents (1:1)
  - Designs orchestration flow
  - Plans data handoffs and validation
         ↓
/agents:create presents design to user for approval
```

### Phase 2: Sub-Agent Creation
```
For each sub-agent in design:
  /agents:create invokes subagent-creator
         ↓
  Provides detailed specifications:
    - Purpose and responsibilities
    - Tool requirements
    - Workflow phases
    - Input/output formats
    - Quality standards
         ↓
  subagent-creator creates sub-agent file
         ↓
  /agents:create validates creation
         ↓
  Repeat for all sub-agents
```

### Phase 3: Orchestration Command Creation
```
For each command in design:
  /agents:create invokes command-creator
         ↓
  Provides detailed specifications:
    - Purpose and workflow
    - Phase-by-phase instructions
    - Sub-agent invocation prompts
    - Coordination logic
    - Output format and quality standards
         ↓
  command-creator creates command file
         ↓
  /agents:create validates creation
         ↓
  Repeat for all commands
```

### Phase 4: System Integration & Documentation
```
/agents:create validates complete system:
  - Reviews all created files
  - Verifies naming consistency
  - Checks data flow coherence
  - Validates template compliance
         ↓
/agents:create creates test plan
         ↓
/agents:create generates comprehensive documentation
         ↓
/agents:create delivers complete system with usage guidance
```

## Key Design Principles

### 1. Separation of Concerns
- **Orchestrator** (`/agents:create`): Focuses on workflow, planning, coordination
- **Specialists** (`subagent-creator`, `command-creator`): Focus on artifact creation
- **Templates**: Provide structure and best practices

### 2. Single Responsibility
- Each sub-agent has exactly one focus
- Orchestrator doesn't know how to create files (delegates)
- Specialists don't know about system design (receive specs)

### 3. Detailed Delegation
- Orchestrator provides comprehensive specifications to specialists
- Specialists have access to templates for structure
- Clear input/output contracts between components

### 4. Validation at Every Phase
- Requirements validated before design
- Design validated before creation
- Each artifact validated after creation
- Complete system validated before delivery

### 5. Meta-System Design
- The system creates systems with the same architecture
- Templates guide both creation and usage
- Self-documenting and self-improving

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Creator agent produces incomplete files
**Cause:** Specifications provided to creator agent are too vague
**Solution:** Enhance orchestration command to provide more detailed specifications

### Issue: Command doesn't invoke sub-agents correctly
**Cause:** Sub-agent names don't match or prompts lack context
**Solution:** Validate naming consistency; enhance prompt detail in orchestration command

### Issue: Templates don't match creator agent outputs
**Cause:** Templates updated but creator agents not updated
**Solution:** Keep templates and creator agents in sync; test after template changes

### Issue: Integration validation fails
**Cause:** Data formats between components don't align
**Solution:** Define explicit contracts in specifications; validate earlier in workflow
